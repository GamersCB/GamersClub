					<p><i><b>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</b></i> is a 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter_game">first-person shooter game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch">Treyarch</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>. It is the twelfth entry in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">Call of Duty</a></i> series and the sequel to the 2012 video game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></i>. It was released on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox One</a> on November 6, 2015. A feature-limited version developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beenox">Beenox</a> and Mercenary Technology that only supports multiplayer modes was released on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> and was also the final <i>Call of Duty</i> title released on those platforms.</p>

<p><i>Black Ops III</i> takes place in 2065, 40 years after the events of <i>Black Ops II</i>, amidst the transformative effects of climate change and the emergence of advanced technologies, including cybernetic enhancements. Similar to its predecessors, the story follows a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_ops">black ops</a> soldiers. The game's campaign is designed to support 4-player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_video_game">cooperative gameplay</a>, allowing for bigger, more open level design and less corridor shooting. As the player character is cybernetically enhanced, players have access to various special activities. The game also features a standalone Zombies campaign mode, and a "Nightmares" mode which replaces all enemies as zombies.</p>

<p>Announced in late April 2015, the game is the first <i>Call of Duty</i> video game released after Activision ended its partnership with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Studios">Microsoft Studios</a> and instead partnered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, which secured the timed exclusivity of the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">downloadable content</a>. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics, praising the gameplay, Zombies mode, and amount of content. However, it was also criticized for its story and lack of innovation. The seventh-generation console versions in particular were singled-out for their lack of a campaign and numerous features, as well as them being online-only. It was a commercial success, with it becoming the top-selling retail game in the US in 2015, and one of the most successful titles released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">eighth generation of video game consoles</a>.</p>

<p>Following the years after its release, <i>Black Ops III</i> has gained a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following">cult following</a> and the online modes still remain active; as of 2023, the game saw an average of over 10,000 players a month. A prequel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_4">Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</a></i>, was released on October 12, 2018.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The campaign in <i>Black Ops III</i> is designed to support 4-player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_video_game">cooperative gameplay</a>, allowing for bigger, more open and free level design and less corridor shooting. In addition, the player can customize their character's appearance and clothing. The campaign features its own progression system, featuring unlock tokens which must be used to acquire different weapons and gears as they progress through the campaign. The game features a "realistic" difficulty mode, in which players will get defeated if they are hit by one bullet. Finishing all campaign missions will also unlock "Nightmares" mode, where players can replay the entire campaign with a new narrative, as well as zombies replacing most of the normal enemies.</p>

<p>The multiplayer mode introduces a new momentum based movement system, which utilizes thruster packs to allow players to perform slow boosts into the air, as well as perform wall running and sliding, all the while giving players complete gun control. In addition to the Pick 10 class system from <i>Black Ops II</i>, Treyarch implemented a character system called "Specialists", where players can pick from 9 different soldiers, each with either a special weapon or ability unique to them. In a later update, a tenth specialist named Blackjack was added to the game. Blackjack is able to mimic the abilities of other specialists, and is only playable for a short amount of time upon completing a set of challenges. A new "Gunsmith" feature offers aesthetic variations in weapon attachments, allowing various weapon customization combinations. The Paintshop feature allows players to create their own custom prints onto specific portions of a gun, further emphasizing the depth of customization in the game.</p>

<p>The Zombies mode features a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_(gaming)">XP</a> progression system, which allows players to unlock items in a similar fashion to multiplayer and campaign. Unlockable items include "Gobblegums", which grant players with temporary bonuses, and weapon kits that allow players to modify the appearance and attributes of the guns with various camos and attachments.</p>

<p><i>Black Ops III</i> features several bonus game modes in addition to the three main offerings: Nightmares, an alternate retelling of the campaign that incorporates zombies; Dead Ops Arcade, a top-down shooter mode that acts as a sequel to the original iteration from <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i>, and Freerun, a parkour-inspired game mode where players utilize advanced movement mechanics to navigate the levels and reach the goal.</p>

<h2>Plot</h2>

<h3>Setting and characters</h3>

<p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> takes place in 2065, 40 years after the events of <i>Black Ops II</i>, in a world facing upheaval from conflicts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a> and new technologies. A Third <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_war_(general_term)">Cold War</a> is ongoing between two global alliances, known as the Winslow Accord and the Common Defense Pact. In response to the drone assaults caused by the Nicaraguan narco-terrorist Raul Menendez on June 19, 2025, several countries around the world have developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed-energy_weapon">Directed Energy Air Defense</a> systems that render conventional air forces virtually useless. As such, most of the warfare between countries is done by covert operatives fighting behind enemy lines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_technology">Military technology</a> has progressed to the point where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics">robotics</a> play a major role in combat, and both fully robotic humanoid drones and cyborg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersoldier">supersoldiers</a> have been developed to fight in the battlefield. There is speculation and fear about an eventual robotic takeover.</p>

<p>Like previous installments in the <i>Black Ops</i> series, the campaign follows a team of black ops soldiers, who work for Winslow Accord. The player character (voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Browder">Ben Browder</a> if male and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Brammell">Abby Brammell</a> if female) and Jacob Hendricks (Sean Douglas) are members of the faction's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetwork">wetwork</a> team, while Commander John Taylor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni">Christopher Meloni</a>) and his team Sebastian Diaz (Reynaldo Gallegos), Sarah Hall (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katee_Sackhoff">Katee Sackhoff</a>), and Peter Maretti (Ary Katz), compose the faction's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a> division. Additional characters include: Rachel Kane (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Kimsey">Rachel Kimsey</a>), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency">CIA</a> agent who was romantically involved with Taylor; Sebastian Krueger (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Picardo">Robert Picardo</a>), CEO of the Coalescence Corporation; Yousef Salim (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Amendola">Tony Amendola</a>), a therapist who once worked for Coalescence; and Goh Xiulan (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Chen">Lynn Chen</a>), leader of the Singaporean criminal organization 54 Immortals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League">NFL</a> running back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch">Marshawn Lynch</a> makes a cameo appearance in the game as a 54 Immortals mercenary.</p>

<p>Included in the game is the "Nightmares" campaign mode, which is a retelling of the main campaign with the plot changed to incorporate zombies and other supernatural beings. In this campaign, the lethal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus">Virus</a> 61-15 is released in various cities around the world, turning whoever it infects into zombies. In response, the governments of the world seal off the worst infected areas into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine">Quarantine</a> Zones and form the Deadkillers, cybernetic soldiers trained to exterminate zombies.</p>

<p>The Zombies story in <i>Black Ops III</i> is told in an episodic format, with the launch map, "Shadows of Evil", focusing on a new group of characters: Nero Blackstone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a>), Jessica Rose (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Graham">Heather Graham</a>), Jack Vincent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_McDonough">Neal McDonough</a>) and Floyd Campbell (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Perlman">Ron Perlman</a>), who reside in the fictional Morg City. The four characters are thrown into a twisted version of the city, overrun by zombies, and are guided by a mysterious, unreliable figure called the Shadowman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Picardo">Robert Picardo</a>). "Shadows of Evil" acts as a prologue that leads into the core storyline, focusing on the Dimension 63 version of the original characters: "Tank" Dempsey (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blum">Steve Blum</a>), Nikolai Belinski (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), Takeo Masaki (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kane">Tom Kane</a>) and Edward Richtofen (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_North">Nolan North</a>), who were introduced in the <i>Black Ops II</i> map "Origins", referred to collectively as Primis. Their story continues from where "Origins" left off, as they attempt to prevent the events of the original timeline from ever occurring across the multiverse. Other characters include the leader of Group 935, Doctor Ludvig Maxis (also voiced by Tatasciore), and his daughter Samantha. The downloadable content maps feature the original versions of Primis, referred to as Ultimis, and reintroduce various minor characters mentioned/featured in previous games, including Group 935 scientist Doctor Groph (also voiced by Blum), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services">OSS</a> spy Peter McCain, Dr. Maxis' assistant Sophia (Christa Lewis), the Ascension Group scientist Gersh, as well as introduces the mysterious omnipotent being Doctor Monty (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>). Robert Picardo also briefly reprises his role from <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> as United States Secretary of Defense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> is the twelfth game in the <i>Call of Duty</i> franchise, and the fourth entry in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Black_Ops_story_arc">Black Ops</a></i> series. The game was the second to benefit under publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>'s three-year development cycle, the first being <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Advanced_Warfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a></i>. The cycle allows each of the development teams of the <i>Call of Duty</i> series (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Ward">Infinity Ward</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch">Treyarch</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_Games">Sledgehammer Games</a>) to develop games in a three-year timespan, as opposed to the two allowed previously. <i>Black Ops III</i> uses a heavily modified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine">IW engine</a> used previously in <i>Black Ops II</i>.</p>

<p>On June 9, 2015, versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were confirmed to be under development by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beenox">Beenox</a> and Mercenary Technology. These versions lack some features available on other platforms, such as the game's campaign mode and the remaining DLC contents. On June 15, 2015, it was announced that as part of a new exclusivity deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, all downloadable content for future <i>Call of Duty</i> games, beginning with <i>Black Ops III</i>, would be released first on PlayStation platforms as timed exclusives. This ends a similar exclusivity deal with Microsoft dating back to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a></i>.</p>

<p>According to gaming journalist Jason Schreier, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> was initially intended to include an open-world campaign, but was scrapped during development, resulting in a period of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)">crunch</a> for employees.</p>

<p>A multiplayer beta was released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4">PlayStation 4</a> on August 18, 2015, and was released for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox One</a> on August 26, 2015. All versions of the multiplayer beta ran for six days.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wall_(composer)">Jack Wall</a>, who previously composed the score for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></i>, returned along with Treyarch's Audio Director Brian Tuey to compose the score for the game. The game also featured an instrumental score entitled "Jade Helm", provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a>, for use in the multiplayer mode. Additionally, both Wall, Tuey and Treyarch's Sound Designer Kevin Sherwood contributed to the composition of the Zombies mode's soundtrack, including several new songs performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Siegman">Elena Siegman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malukah">Malukah</a> for each of the maps.</p>

<p>To promote, the DJ and producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrojack">Afrojack</a> did a song for the game, called "Unstoppable".</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<h3>Reveal</h3>

<p>Teasers were released beginning with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat">Snapchat</a> links appearing in the gameplay of <i>Black Ops II</i> as well as a teaser video released by Treyarch. On April 26, 2015, the first reveal trailer for the game was released and revealed the return of the Zombies mode and beta access for people that pre-order the game for the PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The full game was released on November 6, 2015.</p>

<p>On September 29, 2015, the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> account of <i>Call of Duty</i> was temporarily renamed to "Current Events Aggregate". It then began tweeting messages about real-life fashion, movies and a terrorist attack that takes place in Singapore. Activision later revealed that these tweets are fake, and served to promote the game's story campaign. This marketing campaign was strongly criticized for faking news, and publisher Activision was blamed for being "irresponsible". The game's director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Blundell">Jason Blundell</a> said that the team was "shocked" by the negative reaction of the marketing campaign, and offered an apology.</p>

<p><i>Seize Glory</i> is an official live action trailer for <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</i> that was directed by Wayne McClammy and starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan">Michael B. Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cara_Delevingne">Cara Delevingne</a> and Marshawn Lynch. The trailer features Michael B. Jordan following a man named Kevin as he runs through warfare while destroying zombies and robots. The trailer first aired during November 2015.</p>

<p>The trailer begins with “Paint It Black” by The Rolling Stones as the background music. The setting is a war zone of explosions, soldiers, and a demolished city. Michael B. Jordan standing on a tower, watching over the battle, looks at the camera and says, “What? Y’all don't know about Kevin?” Kevin, a younger man, explodes onto the battle field with a large assault rifle. Kevin runs through the chaotic city enjoying himself as he shoots at everything and Michael B. Jordan builds up Kevin's character. Kevin performs exciting moves like sliding down stairs and running on walls. Kevin even eats a sandwich while setting off explosives on enemies. Then, Marshawn Lynch, a star running back in the National Football League, fully geared with weapons and armor slides in, ready to take out a whole room of zombies. Kevin flies in and steals Marshawn's glory. Kevin makes the classic cool guy move by setting of explosives behind him without looking while he walks away. Suddenly, a girl that Michael B. Jordan introduces as Cara, jumps down from the sky and sends Kevin off the screen. Cara, a young woman, takes Kevin's spotlight and starts wreaking havoc on the battle field. Cara, smiling, throws her handguns to the side while walking away from explosions in the background. In the middle of the screen, in bold white letters, appears the slogan, “There's a Soldier in All of Us.”</p>

<p>Activision hired Wayne McClammy as the director. Wayne has been the director of many <i>Call of Duty</i> advertisements. According to Activision Publishing CMO Tim Ellis, the trailer's intent was to show that “The gaming population is so much bigger and more diverse than people may think". Actors Michael B. Jordan and Cara Delevingne were chosen to star in the trailer as both were known by Activision to be fans of the <i>Call of Duty</i> series.</p>

<p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> and the Digital Deluxe Edition counterpart were available to pre-order on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Digital Deluxe Edition comes with the season pass, which can also be ordered separately. Pre-ordering provided access to the <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> multiplayer beta and in-game items for <i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i>, such as custom reticles, an emblem, a calling card, and Advanced Supply Drops. Sony also announced that the <i>Black Ops III</i> beta would come to the PS4 first on August 19 through August 23, 2015. The beta for the PS4 went live on August 18, 2015, several hours earlier than originally announced. After the beta period ended, it was announced that all pre-orders would include the bonus multiplayer map "NUK3TOWN", a remake of the original "Nuketown" map, featured in <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i>, and in <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</i> as "Nuketown 2025". Owing to the lack of the campaign mode, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions included a digital copy of <i>Black Ops</i> as an added bonus, as well as having their price reduced by 10 dollars compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.</p>

The first issue was released on October 28, 2016, and subsequent issues were released throughout 2017.</p>

<p>In addition to the Digital Deluxe Edition, other special editions include the <i>Hardened Edition</i> and the <i>Juggernog Edition</i>.

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical response</h3>

<p>According to review aggregator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</i> received "generally favorable" critic reviews for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and "mixed or average" critic reviews for PC. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot">GameSpot</a></i> awarded it a score of 7 out of 10, saying, "<i>Black Ops III</i> doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the <i>Call of Duty</i> status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)">Polygon</a></i> also gave the game a score of 7 out of 10, saying "<i>Black Ops III</i>'s biggest point of recommendation may be the breadth of content there, and that's a valid point of view. But Treyarch doesn't meaningfully move the series forward here." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN">IGN</a></i> awarded it a score of 9.2 out of 10, saying "With fun 4-player co-op, new powers, and a fleshed out Zombies mode, <i>Black Ops 3</i> is the biggest <i>Call of Duty</i> game yet." Stuart Andrews of <i>Trusted Reviews</i> criticized the setting and narrative, writing "<i>Black Ops 3</i> is a solid installment that will please the series' hardcore fans, but it's not a mainstream crowd-pleaser in the way that last year's <i>Advanced Warfare</i> was", and unfavorably compared it to its predecessors, disparaging that it "focuses entirely on the sci-fi stuff, loses most of its conspiracy theory trappings and brings augmented super-soldiers in. The result sometimes feels less like a third <i>Black Ops</i> game than <i>Call of Duty</i>: Even More <i>Advanced Warfare</i>."</p>

<p>The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions received less praise than the other versions. <i>IGN'</i>s Brian Albert criticised the lack of the campaign in these versions, as well as the poor graphics and long waiting times, but concluded that despite these versions issues, they were still very fun to play.</p>

<p><i>Black Ops III</i> sold over 6.6 million copies in its first week of sales (not including digital) and grossed over $550 million in sales during its first three days of release. In the United Kingdom, the game bested <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_5:_Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></i> to become the top selling game. <i>Black Ops III</i> was the top best selling game in the US according to NPD's figures. <i>Black Ops III</i> later became the top selling game of 2015. According to Activision, <i>Black Ops III</i> was one of the best-selling games released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">eighth generation of video game consoles</a>, and that its financial performance is significantly better than its predecessor, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Advanced_Warfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a></i>.</p>
