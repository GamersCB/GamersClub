					<p><i><b>Call of Duty: Black Ops</b></i> is a 2010 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter_game">first-person shooter game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch">Treyarch</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>. It was released worldwide in November 2010 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a>, with a separate version for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS">Nintendo DS</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Space">n-Space</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspyr">Aspyr</a> later ported the game to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">OS X</a> in September 2012. It is the seventh title in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">Call of Duty</a></i> series and a sequel to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War">Call of Duty: World at War</a></i>.</p>

<p>Set in the 1960s during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>, the game's single-player campaign follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a> operative Alex Mason as he attempts to recall specific memories to locate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station">numbers station</a> set to instruct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet">Soviet</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agents">sleeper agents</a> to deploy chemical weapons across the United States. Locations featured in the game include Cuba, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>, the United States, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, China, Canada, and Laos. The multiplayer component of <i>Black Ops</i> features multiple objective-based game modes that are playable on 14 different maps included with the game. Improvements to loadout options and killstreak rewards are made. A form of virtual currency, COD Points, allows players to purchase weapons and customization options for their in-game character, as well as attachments and customization options for their weapon.</p>

<p>Development for the game began in 2009. Whereas Treyarch worked on both <i>World at War</i> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/007:_Quantum_of_Solace">tie-in video game</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond">James Bond</a> film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace">Quantum of Solace</a></i> simultaneously, they focused specifically on <i>Black Ops</i> during this development cycle. Different teams within Treyarch focused on a certain game mode. <i>Black Ops</i> runs an enhanced version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine">IW 3.0</a> engine used in <i>World at War</i>. The improvements made allowed for bigger campaign levels to be made as well as enhanced lighting. Music was composed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Murray_(composer)">Sean Murray</a>, with licensed music by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem">Eminem</a> appearing in the game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a> also recorded an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Ready_to_Die">original song</a> for the game as well. The marketing of the game began in April 2010.</p>

<p>The game received positive reviews from critics with praise for its story, voice-acting, darker tone and multiplayer modes, although some criticized it for its linear gameplay and technical issues. Among other awards and nominations, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> was nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_the_Year_awards">Game of the Year</a> by numerous media outlets and award shows, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Achievement_Awards">Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Games_Awards">British Academy Games Awards</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Video_Game_Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>. Within 24 hours of going on sale, the game had sold more than 5.6 million copies, breaking the record set by its predecessor <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2">Modern Warfare 2</a></i> by some 2.3 million copies. The game had sold over 25 million copies worldwide, making it, at the time, the best selling game of all time in the United States, and it remains one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games">best-selling games</a> of all time. A sequel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></i>, was released in 2012. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_Cold_War">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a></i>, set between <i>Black Ops</i> and <i>Black Ops II</i>, was released in 2020.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p><i>Black Ops</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a>, retaining the same gameplay mechanics as previous <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">Call of Duty</a></i> titles. The player assumes the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry">foot soldier</a> who can wield various firearms (only two of which can be carried at once), throw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_grenade">grenades</a> and other explosives, and use other equipment as weapons. A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can take three stances: standing, crouching, or prone. Each affects the rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can drop to the prone stance from the standing stance while running (colloquially known as "dolphin diving"), and can momentarily sprint before stopping.</p>

<p>The screen glows red to indicate damage to a player's health, which regenerates over time. When the character is within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_radius">blast radius</a> of a live grenade, an on-screen marker indicates where it is in relation to the player, helping the player to move away or to throw it back. Among the weapons new to the series in <i>Black Ops</i> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow">crossbows</a> with bolts and explosive ammunition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon's_breath_(ammunition)">Dragon's Breath</a> rounds and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_knife">ballistic knives</a>.</p>

<p>The player assumes the role of various characters during the single-player campaign, changing perspectives throughout the story. The playable characters are covert operatives conducting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_operation">black operations</a> behind enemy lines. Each mission features a series of objectives that are displayed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_gaming)">heads-up display</a>, which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives as it has been in the earlier versions. The player is accompanied by friendly troops throughout the game. Although primarily a first-person shooter, certain levels feature sequences where the player pilots a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-24">Hind helicopter</a> and guides friendly troops from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SR-71_Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a> reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the campaign features several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_sequence">scripted</a> cinematic moments.</p>

<h3>Multiplayer</h3>

<p>The online multiplayer mode of <i>Black Ops</i> usually revolves around two teams on a specific mission. For example, in Team Deathmatch the team with the most kills wins, while in Capture the Flag, players take the other team's flags and return it to their base. Additionally, there is Free For All in which players are not separated into teams. Not including Downloadable maps, there are 14 different maps.</p>

<p><i>Black Ops</i> retains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point">experience points</a> and unlockable reward system that has been kept since <i>Call of Duty 4</i>. The multiplayer focuses on socialization and customization. "Create-a-Class 2.0" allows enhanced personalization with appearance items as well as upgradable perks; weapons are extensively customizable with writing, emblems, attachments, and camouflage painting. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticle">reticles</a> can be modified.</p>

<p>There is more than one style for an attachment, which allows for a lot more personalized weaponry; for example, the player can choose between a red dot sight or a reflex sight, both of which share many of the same traits, although the red dot fills up less of the screen (something desired by many players). Character models depend on the first tier perk instead of the weapon's type. Furthermore, face paints can be unlocked. New custom killstreak rewards include explosive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_car">R/C cars</a>, guided missiles, and controllable attack helicopters.</p>

<p>A currency system has been implemented allowing players to buy weapons, accessories, and clothes. Players can gamble with their "COD Points" in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch_(gaming)">free-for-all</a> based playlist called "Wager Match", which is composed of four game modes. Time-limited objectives known as "Contracts" can be purchased to gain more currency and experience points. The progression system is not featured in the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_(computer_graphics)">split-screen</a> multiplayer. In the local split-screen play, all character customization options are already unlocked. Players can no longer define game rules such as win conditions.</p>

<p>Players can play alone or with friends against AI opponents in "Combat Training" with a separate progression system. Online split-screen is re-introduced on Xbox 360 and PS3. The guest account can rank up but is reset after each sign out. Only on Xbox 360, a second Gold Xbox Live account can be used to keep the second player's progression. Aside from the Combat Training mode, Xbox users can also have up to four players in split-screen mode play against AI opponents even without having an Xbox Live account. This is done by configuring the Local Split Screen settings and setting the number of enemies to a value greater than zero.</p>

<p>For the first time in the series, clips from online gameplay can be recorded. Some specific features that have been removed from the PC version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Ward">Infinity Ward</a>'s <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> return, such as lean, mod tools, the developer console, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server#Dedicated_game_server">dedicated servers</a>. Dedicated servers are exclusively provided by Game Servers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a> is the exclusive platform for <i>Black Ops</i> on PC, and the game is protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat">Valve Anti-Cheat</a>.</p>

<p>The Wii version of the game includes in-game voice chat. This is the first <i>Call of Duty</i> title to include the voice chat feature for the Wii. Nintendo and PDP have partnered to release the first headset to be used with the Wii known as PDP's Headbanger Headset.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(fictional)">zombie</a> co-op mode, titled "Zombies", can be played with four players online or as a two-player split screen co-op mode. Originally featured in <i>World at War</i>, it was revamped to be included in <i>Black Ops</i> and future titles.</p>

<p>In this mode, one to four players fight an unlimited number of waves of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie">zombies</a>, beginning with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol">M1911</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun">pistol</a>. Players earn points for killing zombies or repairing boarded-up windows, which are used to expand areas of the map, access stronger weapons, or upgrade existing weapons. Zombies routinely break the windows to enter and attack the players; if a player is attacked enough times, they fall and will need to be "revived" by another player in a certain time, or will respawn in the next round with their weapon progress reverted if they are not revived. The game ends when all players are damaged enough to fall. The base game features three maps, "Five", "Kino Der Toten", and the unlockable "Dead Ops Arcade".</p>

<p>Dead Ops Arcade is an unlockable game mode that the player can unlock by typing "DOA" within the data terminal of the main menu. Once unlocked, the player is transferred to play a retro arcade version of the main zombie's game mode. New elements like extra lives, unique mini maps, and zombie bosses are present within the game mode. Dead Ops Arcade includes co-op playthrough through either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_network">Xbox Live</a> or split screen of up to 4 players.</p>

<h3>Characters and setting</h3>

<p><i>Black Ops</i>'s single-player campaign takes place between 1961 and 1968 during both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>, 16 years to 23 years after the events of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War">World at War</a></i>. It portrays a secret history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_operations">black operations</a> carried out behind enemy lines by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a>. Missions take place in various countries around the globe, including Cuba, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>, the United States, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Canada, and Laos. The single-player campaign revolves around the CIA's attempts to stop Soviet sleeper agents embedded in the US, to be activated via broadcasts from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station">numbers station</a>, from deploying an experimental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent">nerve agent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon">chemical weapon</a> known as "Nova 6".</p>

<p>The player controls the protagonist, CIA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Division">SAD/SOG</a> operative and former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance">Marine Force Recon</a> Captain Alex Mason (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington">Sam Worthington</a>). Other characters are occasionally playable, such as CIA paramilitary operations officer Jason Hudson (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris">Ed Harris</a>). Mason is often joined by fellow operatives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Recon">Force Recon</a> Master Sergeant Frank Woods (James C. Burns) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_Demolition_Teams">Navy UDT</a> Chief Joseph Bowman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube">Ice Cube</a>), while Hudson works with Grigori Weaver (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Farber">Gene Farber</a>), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-American">Russian-American</a> field operative. Viktor Reznov (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>), a character of the Soviet campaign in <i>World at War</i>, returns along with protagonist Dimitri Petrenko (Boris Kievsky). Oldman also voices Daniel Clarke, an English scientist assisting in the development of Project Nova. Opposing the CIA are the leaders of Project Nova: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Army">Soviet Army</a> Major General Nikita Dragovich (Eamon Hunt), Colonel Lev Kravchenko (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Divoff">Andrew Divoff</a>), and ex-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi">Nazi</a> scientist Friedrich Steiner (Mark Bramhall). <i>Black Ops</i> also features the appearance of several historical figures; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro">Fidel Castro</a> (Gustavo Rex), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Picardo">Robert Picardo</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> (Chriss Anglin).</p>

<p>The Zombies mode takes place over various eras of time, mostly during the final year of World War II and the 1960s. The story mainly follows a crew of four soldiers: "Tank" Dempsey (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blum">Steve Blum</a>) of the United States Marine Corps, Nikolai Belinski (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>) of the Red Army, Takeo Masaki (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kane">Tom Kane</a>) of the Imperial Japanese Army, and Doctor Edward Richtofen (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_North">Nolan North</a>) of the Wehrmacht. Other characters include Doctor Ludvig Maxis (Fred Tatasciore), the leader of the research group known as Group 935, and his daughter Samantha (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Nathanson">Julie Nathanson</a>). The map "Five" features a second crew comprising historical figures: John F. Kennedy (Jim Meskimen), Robert McNamara (Robert Picardo), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Mallow">Dave Mallow</a>), and Fidel Castro (Marlon Correa).

Romero</a>, portraying fictional versions of themselves, with the former four acting as playable characters.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>In May 2009, publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a> was rumored to be looking for licensing regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>-era music which led to speculation that <i>Call of Duty 7</i> would be set in Vietnam.  In November 2009, only a few days before <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>'s release, Activision officially announced a new <i>Call of Duty</i> title for 2010 through their third quarter financial call. In February 2010, a casting call for <i>Call of Duty 7</i> led to speculation that the game would be taking place during the Cold War era with some battles taking place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. On April 30, 2010, <i>Black Ops</i> was officially announced.</p>

<p>The game runs on an enhanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine"><i>World at War</i> engine</a> (which itself was improved from <i>Call of Duty 4</i>'s) at 60 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">frames per second</a> across all platforms, excluding the Wii. It features a streaming texture technology (also seen in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>), making bigger levels possible such as "Payback" where the player controls a helicopter. Lighting effects have been improved as well. <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy">3-D imaging</a> rendered by the engine itself. This feature is available on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">PC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> versions.</p>

<p>For <i>Black Ops</i>, Treyarch focused only on this game unlike past practice. However, it had different teams, each working on separate game modes. Treyarch used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture">motion capture</a> technology similar to the one used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a></i>, which allows accurate facial expressions, capturing the whole performance of the actor. The studio also consulted special forces veterans from both belligerents of the Cold War: Major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Plaster">John Plaster</a> (US Army-Ret.) who served in the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and former Soviet special forces operative Sonny Puzikas. The latter taught Treyarch how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spetsnaz">Spetsnaz</a> soldiers would react in combat, such as rolling out of the line of fire. Spetsnaz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI">AIs</a> in the game have been modeled after him, from his tactics and his movements to his face. Although having a historical background, the classified aspect of these Cold War black operations allowed the studio to create its own fictional story. The game also allows players to turn down the blood and turn off the profanity.</p>

<p>It was announced on November 9, 2015, that <i>Black Ops</i> would become backward compatible with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox One</a>. It was originally meant to be available for backward compatibility in December 2015, but the date was later changed to some time in 2016. <i>Black Ops</i> was originally the sixth-most requested Xbox 360 title to become backward compatible with the Xbox One. On May 17, 2016, the game was made available through Xbox One's backward compatibility. Shortly after, it was reported that sales of the Xbox 360 version had increased by 13,000 percent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<p><i>Black Ops</i> features the voices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington">Sam Worthington</a> as Alex Mason, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris">Ed Harris</a> as Jason Hudson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman">Gary Oldman</a> reprises his role as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Reznov">Viktor Reznov</a> from <i>World at War</i> and also voices Dr. Clarke, James C.

In the Call of the Dead zombie map the song "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Ready_to_Die">Not Ready to Die</a>" by American heavy metal band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a> is featured as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a>. The original music was composed by Sean Murray, who also composed <i>Call of Duty: World at War</i> while Kevin Sherwood composed music for the Zombies mode. The soundtrack was released on November 9. The use of The Rolling Stones' music in the game has seen a significant increase in the band's music sales since launch. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_Shelter">Gimme Shelter</a>" sold 2,000 copies in the week before the launch trailer was revealed, 5,000 the week after, and 11,000 the week after the game's release. "Sympathy for the Devil" experienced a similar boost as gamers discovered the band's music.</p>

<p>The game's score was composed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Murray_(composer)">Sean Murray</a>, and the official soundtrack was released on November 9, 2010. A second soundtrack, containing music from the games <i>Zombies</i> mode, was released on January 25, 2011.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p><i>Black Ops</i> was first revealed when the games official website went live on April 30, 2010, with a teaser trailer premiering on GameTrailers TV Episode 310. In early April 2010, an unmarked envelope was sent to various gaming news publications as well as high-profile <i>Call of Duty</i> fans via mail. It contained a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive">USB flash drive</a> with sound and text files. These files were codes to be decrypted, only to find a mysterious teaser site for an unknown game. Other codes were updated periodically.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup></p>

<p>Treyarch released the "First Strike" Map Pack on February 1, 2011, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a> received the map pack on March 3, 2011, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">PC</a> version was released on March 25, 2011, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a>.

These maps include "Berlin Wall", "Discovery", "Kowloon" and "Stadium" and a map for the Zombies mode titled "Ascension" which takes place in a Soviet launch site.</p>

<p>On April 11, 2011, a second map pack called "Escalation" was announced by Activison and Microsoft. It features 4 new multiplayer maps named "Zoo", "Hotel", "Convoy", "Stockpile" and one new zombies map named 'Call of the Dead'. This map is based on the movies by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero">George A. Romero</a>, the revolutionary epic-zombie-horror director. The trailer for this map shows the four playable characters: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Trejo">Danny Trejo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Englund">Robert Englund</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rooker">Michael Rooker</a>. The name is a reference to the immensely popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Series">Dead Series</a> created and directed by Romero. The trailer also offers a sneak peek of a zombiefied version of George A. Romero himself, lurking out of water. The map is set on a ship, but with the ship's crew as zombies instead of Nazi zombies. It was released on May 3, 2011, for the Xbox 360, June 2 on the PC and June 10 for the PlayStation 3.</p>
