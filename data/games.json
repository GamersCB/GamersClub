    "description": "Demon’s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls trilogy. Demon’s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.\nYour character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles. Demon’s Souls combat system is quite complicated as you can’t gain experience killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent deaths.\nHowever, there’s a way to simplify the game a little. Some of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it’s white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When it’s black, it produces the opposite effect.",

Get ready for the ultimate survival stealth action experience.\nThe Cold War Crisis that started it all\nIn the middle of the Cold War, Naked Snake, the man who would later be known as Big Boss, infiltrates the Soviet Union to escort a defecting scientist, Sokolov. However, the mission ends in failure when Snake's mentor—The Boss, a soldier known as the mother of special forces—betrays him, and Sokolov is captured by Colonel Volgin of the GRU.\nOne week later, Snake returns to Soviet territory to rescue Sokolov and eliminate The Boss—a mission that will mark the start of a new legend, a mission that will mark the start of a new legend, against the backdrop of the ever-changing march of history.\nEverything you love, and more\nThe story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music that made the original a sensation return, remade for modern consoles. This evolutionary leap breathes new life into every cutscene, and rebuilds every corner of the world.\nGorgeously rendered graphics\nWith Unreal Engine 5, expansive stages are rendered with cutting-edge technology. Incredible new graphics bring the wild growth of the jungles, forests, and swamps to life in exquisite detail. Characters are rendered in such fine detail that facial wrinkles, pores, and even separate eye and iris movements are visible, allowing for rich and emotive facial animations.\nAuthentic to life portrayals\nThe battle damage system has been upgraded, with the wear and tear of Snake's clothes, as well as bruises and bullet wounds on his body, reflected in real time. Injuries will leave their mark on Snake's body permanently, telling a story of each player's unique journey through the game.\nDeeply immersive experiences\nPlayers can elect for a newly added, more modern control style.

Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done, players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals, bandits and murderers. Discover the mystery of a long forgotten the Eternal Empire, and survive.\nMechanics are pretty simple. Choose one of six different classes, gather gems for more skills to use and grind good and synergising equipment.

Each god has three base abilities, one ultimate ability, and one passive ability.

Such items don't require mana but have a long recovery time.\nThe goal of the game is to destroy the opposing team's lane defenders and their Titan. Players are followed by minions that deal small amounts of damage to towers, lane defenders, the Titan or the opposing players.\nSmite features a five-class system. Players are free to choose from assassin, warrior, mage, hunter and guardian classes. Each class has it's own specifics and should be carefully chosen according to the situation on the arena.\nIn contrast to other MOBA's, there are multiple game modes in Smite.

    "description": "###The restart\nReleased in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.\n\n###Key features\nIn the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.\n\n###The changes\nThe main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.",

In true Black Ops fashion, the fictional story builds on the history of the time, thrusting you into a strange and clandestine conspiracy where a shadowy force has infiltrated the U.S. government. Anyone who resists is branded as a traitor, forcing players to go rogue for the first time to fight the very machine that created them. Nothing is what it seems, and the truth may be hard to fathom, drawing you ever deeper into intrigue, distrust, and mind-bending psychological revelations. This is true, signature Black Ops style.\n\nInitial Intel: Multiplayer: Offering a massive amount of content at launch, expect 16 brand new Multiplayer maps on Day One, including 12 Core 6v6 maps and four small-sized Strike maps, the latter of which are unique, stand-alone locations designed to be played in 2v2 or Face Off 6v6 matches. Multiplayer is also where you’ll test your skills and learn how to move like an action hero, with innovations like Omnimovement – allowing you to sprint, slide and dive in any direction – as well as Intelligent Movement (sprinting, mantling, and crouch assists allowing you to focus on achieving incredible and complex maneuvers with ease), increased enemy hit zones, an incredible lineup of gear, HUD optimizations, and the return of Theatre Mode and Classic Prestige!\n\nAll designed to ensure this game is the ultimate Black Ops Multiplayer experience.\n\nInitial Intel: Round-Based Zombies: Black Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favourite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead. Expect two brand-new maps at launch, and an impressive number of secrets to discover.\n\nPRE-ORDER NOW ON XBOX GAMEPASS",

You can throw spikes on the road or use turbo acceleration to break away from the pursuit. Police can block the road and summon a helicopter for help from above. \nAdditionally, Hot Pursuit features a new Autolog social system. With it, you can compete with your friends and see the statistics on every race. The system compares your results with your friends' ones and notifies you every time your record is beaten.",

A full arsenal of modern weapons, from dozens of models of knives, small and heavier guns, from boats and helicopters to tanks and warships - all this is either at the player's disposal or meets him during missions. On land and sea, in the city and in the air. The game responds to everyone and everything. Weather - rain and wind change everything, as in life. The wet foliage behaves differently than the dry, gusts of the wind act on everything in the entire space of the map, the shower makes the air less transparent, thickens the darkness. Water is not just a surface, but water, with waves that you swing - in multiplayer, these waves are for everyone, their behavior is calculated exactly as the real waves would behave, players feel them precisely with the same difference for their position, as if they were in the actual sea, on the same wavelength, but in different places. Seven missions, five additions, three variants of the ending. The ability to see the gameplay through the eyes of any of the players, above the entire card, in a third-person mode and in the \"Free Cam\" mode. Multiple multiplayer modes, classes and game factions.",

    "description": "Call of Duty: World at War is a first-person shooter set during World War II and based on several historical battles. The action switches between three playable characters and covers the Pacific Theater and Eastern Front. The story begins with U.S. Marine Private C. Miller who is captured by the Japanese and waits for execution. Later it jumps over war theaters and the timeline, skipping entire months.\r\nThe battles in World at War are quite realistic, with the maximum of two weapons you can carry plus hand grenades. AI allies fight alongside to you, and there's also a cover system that helps to restore health and complete stealthy missions. The variety of levels includes PBY missions, sniper tasks, and sea battles. \r\nWorld at War is the first game of the franchise to introduce Nazi Zombies mode - a cooperative mini-game where 2 to 4 players fight endless hordes of zombies. While the area cover in this mode is quite small, it was expanded by the World at War map packs.",

    "description": "Metro Exodus is the third installment in the Metro series. It is based on the series of post-apocalyptic novels by Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky. The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.\nPlot\nExodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth's surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series' canon). \nGameplay\nThe player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>The Witcher</b></i> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language\">Polish</a>: <i>Wiedźmin</i> .mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}pronounced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Polish\">[ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]</a>) is a 2007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game\">action role-playing game</a> developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt_Red\">CD Projekt Red</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_SA\">Atari</a> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows\">Windows</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X\">OS X</a>. It was based on the fantasy novel series <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher\">The Witcher</a></i> by Polish author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski\">Andrzej Sapkowski</a>. The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga.</p>\n\n<p>It received positive reviews from critics. A console version, <i>The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf</i>, was scheduled for release in 2009 using an entirely new engine and combat system. This was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. A sequel, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings\">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a></i>, was released in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake\">remake</a> of <i>The Witcher</i> was announced in October 2022, which was formerly first teased under the codename \"Canis Majoris\". Entitled <i>The Witcher Remake</i>, it will be developed using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_5\">Unreal Engine 5</a>, the same engine in use for the planned second trilogy. Fool's Theory will mainly develop the remake with full creative supervision from <i>The Witcher</i> series staff and CD Projekt Red.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>There are three camera styles available in <i>The Witcher</i>: two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_video_game_graphics\">isometric</a> perspectives, where the mouse is used to control most functions, and an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_(video_games)\">over-the-shoulder view</a>, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat while limiting vision. In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a combined keyboard and mouse approach.</p>\n\n<p>The story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia\">Geralt of Rivia</a>, one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for more rapid, less-damaging attacks with a higher chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combo_(video_games)\">combos</a> to damage enemies more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Alchemy is a significant part of the gameplay. The player can create potions that increase <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(game_terminology)\">health</a> or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion, he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. Each time Geralt drinks potions, they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace. In addition to potions, the player can create oils used to augment the damage done by weapons. They can also create bombs for use as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)#Skills\">skills</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A time-delayed decision-consequence system means that the repercussions of players' decisions will make themselves apparent in plot devices in later acts of the game. This helps avert a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_scumming\">save-reload approach</a> to decision making. It also adds to the game's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_value\">replay value</a>, as the consequences resulting from the player's decisions can lead to significant differences in the events that take place later, and ultimately a very different gameplay experience than in prior playthroughs. The player often finds themselves choosing between the lesser of two evils.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<h3>Setting and characters</h3>\n\n<p>Set in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher#Setting\">Continent of the Witcher franchise</a>, the player assumes the role of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia\">Geralt of Rivia</a>, a wandering genetically enhanced monster hunter for hire. The game takes place around five years after the events of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_the_Lake_(Sapkowski_novel)\"><i>The Lady of the Lake</i></a>. Geralt is accompanied by his longtime allies and fellow witchers, Eskel, Lambert, and instructor Vesemir, as well as sorceress <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triss_Merigold\">Triss Merigold</a> of Maribor and the field medic Shani. In addition, characters in the game originally from the books include Geralt's companions <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion_(The_Witcher)\">Dandelion</a> the poet, the dwarf Zoltan Chivay, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Witcher_series#King_Foltest\">King Foltest</a> of Temeria, his daughter Princess Adda (who was previously cursed into the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigoi\">striga</a>, but was cured by Geralt), King Radovid of Redania, and the spectral <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Witcher_series#Eredin_Bréacc_Glas_(King_of_the_Wild_Hunt)\">King of the Wild Hunt</a>, a conqueror from another world. Characters original to the game include the boy Alvin, the sorcerer Azar Javed, the mercenary Professor, and Jacques de Alderberg, the Grand Master of the religious faction Order of the Flaming Rose.</p>\n\n<p>Geralt awakens at the School of the Wolf's mountain fortress Kaer Morhen, with no memory of who he is or how he arrived there. He is taken in by his witcher brothers as well as Triss Merigold, who seeks a remedy for his mysterious condition. Kaer Morhen is suddenly attacked by an unknown group of assailants, who escape with the School of the Wolf's key mutagens and formulae that detail how to create witchers. Pursuing this faction, Geralt travels to the Temerian capital Vizima. On the way, he saves Alvin, a magically gifted peasant child. Triss determines that Alvin is a Source, a genetic magic prodigy similar to Ciri, Geralt's foster daughter. The player has the choice of leaving Alvin in the care of either Triss or Shani, a Redanian medic and Geralt's friend. Alvin is given a magical amulet meant to keep his abilities in check while he learns magic.</p>\n\n<p>Geralt pursues several leads on the group which attacked Kaer Morhen and learns that they are known as Salamandra, and ostensibly led by the foreign mage Azar Javed. To further complicate matters, tensions are high in the city due to the conflict between the religious fanatics the Order of the Flaming Rose, and the elven terrorist faction the Scoia'tael. With the help of various allies in Vizima, Geralt assaults a Salamandra base in Vizima and kills the Professor, a dangerous mercenary in the employ of the criminal syndicate, but is then betrayed by Princess Adda and is teleported to a village on the outskirts of the city by Triss. The previously peaceful hamlet becomes a battleground when armed conflict breaks out between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael. Geralt is forced to choose to support either faction, or make enemies of them both. Alvin is frightened and, using his Source abilities, magically disappears.</p>\n\n<p>When Geralt returns to Vizima, he finds that Temeria's regent King Foltest has also returned while Adda has relapsed in her curse and is in striga form once more. Under Foltest's direction, Geralt either assists the knights or the elves to restore order to the city as well as deals with Adda. Geralt then storms the Salamandra headquarters and kills Azar Javed, only to find that the gang's true leader is Jacques de Aldersberg, the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Foltest hires Geralt under a contract to slay Jacques to end the Salamandra threat. Geralt confronts Jacques, who explains that due to his Source abilities he has seen the eventual extinction of humanity because of the world-ending White Frost, and was attempting to engineer a genetically enhanced superior race of humans to survive this apocalypse. Geralt is also confronted by the King of the Wild Hunt, who warns him of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt\">impending conflict</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After Geralt defeats and slays Jacques, he notices the Grand Master was wearing the same amulet as Alvin, revealing that de Aldersberg was actually the village boy he saved earlier, who traveled back in time by accident. After Geralt returns to Foltest with news of his success, the king is attacked by an assassin. Geralt defeats the assassin, to which Foltest brings Geralt back into his service to assist with the war he has waged in reclamation of his children, Anais and Boussy. As the war comes to a close, Geralt during an assault on La Valette castle, escorts Foltest to his children, however an unknown assailant assassinates Foltest, fleeing the scene as Geralt charges to the kings aid. Guards see Geralt and think he attacked the king, leading directly into <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings\">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a></i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>Before CD Projekt's involvement, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_Software\">Metropolis Software</a> (which CD Projekt bought in 2009 and closed in 2010) had obtained a license from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski\">Andrzej Sapkowski</a> for his novels in <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher\">The Witcher</a></i> series, around 1997. However, due to several other projects that the studio was involved in at the time, and concerns from their publisher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TopWare\">TopWare</a> about the materials' international appeal, the project never got further than some initial media and a playable level.</p>\n\n<p>CD Projekt later approached Sapkowski for rights for the series. They were able to secure the rights for about 35,000 zloty (approximately US$9,500) from Sapkowski, who wanted all the payment upfront, rather than through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalties\">royalties</a>, even though these were offered to him. In a 2017 interview, Sapkowski said that at the time he had no interest in video games, and was only looking at the deal from a financial benefit standpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The developers cited the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series)\">Gothic series</a> of role-playing games as a primary influence. CD Project had localized and published <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)\"><i>Gothic</i></a> (released in Poland in 2002) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_II\">Gothic II</a></i> (in 2003) in Poland. Both games as well as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_3\">Gothic 3</a></i> (released in 2006) became very popular in Poland and therefore a success for CD Project as a regional publisher of said games. CD Project received Business Gazelle awards in 2003 and 2004.</p>\n\n<h3>Game engine</h3>\n\n<p><i>The Witcher</i> is powered by a modified version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Engine\">Aurora Engine</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare\">BioWare</a>, but using its own rendering engine. optimized heavily for the game's singleplayer requirements. Many changes have been introduced to the original engine; some of them are described below.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most important changes to the Aurora Engine involved developing the in-game environments in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3ds_Max\">3ds Max</a> and then exporting them into the game engine, rather than using a tile-based system. This allowed the developers to make every environment unique from the others, rather than recycling the same tiled objects over and over again in different environments. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt\">CD Projekt</a>'s version of the engine also supports lightmaps generated in 3ds Max. Shadows created this way are reported to look more realistic, and provide better game performance.</p>\n\n<p>The modified engine also includes texture paint, a special tool that allows the developer to paint the environment using custom textures. New realistic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games)\">skyboxes</a> and water effects designed specifically for <i>The Witcher</i> were added to the engine. Natural light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich the game's ambiance. The weather can dynamically change between various states, such as clear skies, light rainfall or thunderstorms.</p>\n\n<p>Other significant changes include motion-captured animation, improved physics modeling, new mechanics, and a new combat system. Additional modifications include the introduction of portals and the inclusion of other graphical effects, such as glows, advanced dynamic shadows, blurs and others.</p>\n\n<p>All the female portrait cards shown after Geralt's \"sexual conquests\" were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship\">censored</a> (\"retouched to a more modest standard\") for the U.S. release version. The in-game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryad\">dryad</a> was also reskinned, so her hair covered more of her body in this release. Some of the previously censored content, such as the romance cards, were uncensored for the Enhanced Edition.</p>\n\n<p>Some dialogue between characters is shortened in the non-Polish-language versions. Lead designer Michal Madej has disputed claims by fans that this was due to the sometimes crude language, but that the decision to edit down dialogue occurred because of production-related concerns in game development. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading\">Proofreader</a> Martin Pagan noticed this shortened version during his work, and writer Sande Chen confirmed that it was not due to censorship. Fans have theorized that it may have been done for voice acting cost savings, especially since much of the vulgar language has been retained.</p>\n\n<p>On 31 August 2006, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Europe\">Atari Europe</a> announced they would publish and distribute the game in Europe and Asian territories. A North American publishing and distribution deal with fellow subsidiary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_Inc._(1993–present)\">Atari, Inc.</a> was later announced on 5 February 2007.</p>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference\">Game Developers Conference</a> 2008, CD Projekt Red announced an enhanced version of the game, which was released on 16 September 2008. The significant changes featured in the enhanced version are over 200 new animations, additional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">NPC</a> models, and recoloring of generic NPC models as well as monsters, vastly expanded and corrected dialogues in translated versions, improved stability, redesigned inventory system and load times reduced by roughly 80%. In addition, all bugs are said to be fixed, and the game manual completely overhauled. There are also two new adventures available to play through: <i>Side Effects</i> and <i>The Price of Neutrality</i>. A new option is to set the language of the voice acting and text separately. For instance, players can now choose to play the game with Polish <!-- original is Polish, so I'd say that's most fitting example --> voices and English subtitles. Other featured languages are Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Czech, Hungarian, and Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the game enhancements, <i>The Witcher Enhanced Edition</i> includes a \"making of\" DVD, a CD with 29 in-game soundtracks, another CD with \"Inspired by\" music, the short story <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Wish_(book)#The_Witcher\">The Witcher</a></i> from the book <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Wish_(book)\">The Last Wish</a></i>, a map of Temeria printed on high-quality paper, and the official strategy guide. In addition, a new and enhanced version of the D'jinni Adventure Editor is on the DVD with the two new Adventures. The game updates, as well as the box's extras, are available as a free download for owners of the original version who registered their game on the official forum. Furthermore, old savegames are compatible with the <i>Enhanced Edition</i>.</p>\n\n<p>According to CD Projekt co-founder Michal Kicinski, the <i>Enhanced Edition</i> required a $1 million investment, and the company had shipped 300,000 copies of the retail version worldwide as of December 2008.</p>\n\n<p>CD Projekt released a <i>Director's Cut</i> version of the game in North America on 31 July 2009. It is equal to the <i>Enhanced Edition</i> available to the rest of the world, but without the censorship applied to the North American version. The company has since released an official uncensoring patch that makes the North American version the same as the international for those who have purchased a boxed version of the game.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 November 2008, a video covering the console version of the game was uploaded on the Internet. On 2 December, CD Projekt Red officially confirmed that <i>The Witcher</i> would be ported to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a> consoles and released as <i>The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf</i>. It had been built from the ground up for Widescreen Games' DaVinci Engine and featured a host of differences. According to CD Projekt Red senior designer Jakub Styliński, the game featured a new interface, redesigned boss battles, new music, \"a smattering of new models\", and a redesigned character development system, in addition to an entirely new action-oriented combat system with enhanced AI, additional motion-capture animations and the ability to directly control Geralt's defensive maneuvers. CD Projekt also confirmed that <i>Rise of the White Wolf</i> would have featured <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content\">downloadable content</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On 29 April 2009, it was announced that the production of the game had been halted due to late payments from CD Projekt to the French developers of the console version, Widescreen Games. A release from CD Projekt's CEO Michał Kiciński stated that payments were delayed due to Widescreen Games not meeting development deadlines, additionally saying \"technical incapability created a risk of missing planned quality\" and that CD Projekt had ended their association with the company.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p>The game received mostly positive reviews. The game's cumulative score stands at 81 out of 100 on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>. Michael Lafferty from GameZone gave the game 8.8 out of 10, describing it as a deep, immersive game that will \"ask you to think and make choices, not just hack and slash your way to glory\". <i>The Witcher</i>'s cinematic intro was nominated for the 2007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Effects_Society\">VES Awards</a> in the category of Outstanding Pre-Rendered Visuals in a Video Game, and the game's soundtrack was voted \"Best Fantasy Game Soundtrack\" in the 2007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Rivendell\">Radio Rivendell</a> Fantasy Awards.</p>\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Annual_Interactive_Achievement_Awards\">11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_and_Sciences\">Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</a> named <i>The Witcher</i> as one of the nominees for 2007's \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Role-Playing_Game_of_the_Year\">Role-Playing Game of the Year</a>\"; however, it was eventually awarded to <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_(video_game)\">Mass Effect</a></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die\">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a></i>.</p>\n\n<p>For many years, CD Projekt Red did not publicly disclose detailed sales figures for <i>The Witcher</i>. In 2026, CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski revealed updated lifetime sales data in a public statement on social media. According to Nowakowski, <i>The Witcher</i> (2007) has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. He also noted that the game continues to generate sales years after its original release.</p>\n\n",

    "description": "The game combines the genres of survival horror and role-playing game. The main theme of the game - survival during a zombie apocalypse.\n\nIt has an open and changing world, many opportunities for the manufacture of useful things and cooperation with other characters, to fight hunger, injuries, depression and paranoia.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place in Knox County, Kentucky, USA.\n\nAs a result of the epidemic, a huge part of the population of the district became infected with an unknown virus and turned into a zombie. The few survivors will have to fight for survival.\n\nThe player plays as one of the survivors. The game does not have any definite ending, it cannot be won and it will end when the player’s character dies - and it depends only on him how late it will happen.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game begins with the creation of a character.\n\nThe player can choose the name, gender, race, hairstyle, initial clothing, as well as the presence of a beard and chest hair in a male character.\n\nThen begins the creation of character and part of the background of the character. You can choose the character's profession before the apocalypse. Subsequently, this will affect some of the skills (for example, a former policeman shoots better, a builder builds defenses better, nurses heal wounds more successfully, cooks cook better, etc.).\n\nYou can then choose the positive and negative traits of the character. The negative ones include obesity, laziness, poor eyesight, chronic fatigue, constant thirst, etc. For the chosen negative traits you get points - these points can be spent on the positive traits of this character, such as agility, strength, high disease resistance and even luck.\n\nAfter creating a character, you (or rather, a character) find yourself in a randomly selected house on a game map. The zombie apocalypse has already begun, and your character has to look for a way to survive. In the game, not even very moral ways are allowed to do this: you can loot and rob, you can create a group of honest people and resist both zombies and bandits.\n\nIn addition to winning battles, the hero needs food, water, sleep, rest, and fellowship to survive - constant loneliness can lead to depression.\n\nThe complexity of the game increases constantly and gradually - the activity of zombies increases, electricity and water supply are turned off, and the products deteriorate. However, the player is able to provide a lot for himself - to cook food on a fire, collect rainwater, grow food.\n\nHowever, no action can ensure eternal survival - sooner or later the character dies. The slogan at the beginning of each new game is pessimistic: “This is the story of your death.”",

    "description": "Monster Hunter: World is the fifth game in the Japanese franchise Monster Hunter, which is about hunting giant beasts. It is set in a medieval fantasy setting, on a continent known as the New World that is being colonized by the humans from the Old World. The plot revolves around a dragon migration called Elder Crossing. Your protagonist is a hunter, whose name and appearance can be customized. You traveled from the Old World to study and hunt the dragons and other local monsters.  \nThe hunter, accompanied by an assistant, starts at the city of Astera, from where they can freely wander the open world. There are six regions in the New World, each with its own base camp. The camps are where you have to thoroughly prepare before every expedition, gathering equipment and provision. Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter’s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system. Many items that you found on missions, including body parts of monsters, can be used for crafting.",

    "description": "Sometimes in order to be fresh, famous video game series take another path and tell a different story. Battlefield Hardline also tried to refresh series and instead on focusing on military warfare, Hardline is about crime, heist ant policing elements. The game takes place in the streets of Los Angeles and there are two main factions in the game - Special Response Units of police and criminals. As in the other Battlefield games, players have an option to use various vehicles and weapons. As in Battlefield 4, Hardline uses the “Levolution” mechanic, which lets players completely destroy various buildings, and this mechanic is almost in every mission of Battlefield: Hardline. There are also new game modes, including Heist, Rescue, Hotwire, Blood Money and Crosshair. \nBattlefield: Hardline is the last game made by Visceral Games. It was promised prior to the release of the game that the main single-player campaign will not be linear – it features episodic crime dramas, where players have to choose how they want the story to go.",

    "description": "Cities: Skylines is a traditional city-building game, which allows players to experience urban planning in all aspects including zoning, road placement, transportation, taxation, and improvement of welfare. Therefore, within the game players are able to assume roles of city’s principal architect and mayor. The history of the city, in control of the player, begins with the 2-by-2 kilometers plot of land and a sum of money to start with. Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city’s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution. The game also features a creative sandbox mode, where the architect’s imagination is not restricted in any way.",

Nilin, the heroine, can penetrate into the memory of people, she changes the past on which people base their actions in the present. Once she is subjected to a complete erasure of memory. She has to start a battle for herself - for the self that she does not even remember.\nSetting, plot, design and lighting immediately evokes a masterpiece of cyberpunk - «Blade Runner». But the game is noticeably superior to the movie regarding «volume» of space, the sensation of «air» and «presence» in the game. There is an impression that you see the world of the game 360 ​​degrees around you. Mimicry and plastic of characters are directed in each detail, undoubtedly dramatic, give a full impression of a play of live actors. It seems that even the movements of inanimate objects are filled with the same expressiveness - for example, the trajectories of a thrown pistol or splinters ... High level of directing and corresponding levels of design and graphics. A mass of significant finds, filling every frame with emotion and senses.",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed II is the second installment in the AC series, the center of which is stealths kills, exploring the world and enemy encounters. It is the straight sequel to the first part of the series and the beginning of the Ezio — the protagonist — trilogy, followed by 'Brotherhood' and 'Revelation.'\nThe events take place in Rome, during the Italian Renaissance (1476-1499), we play as Ezio Auditore and are fighting against Knight Templar, being the Assassins. At the same time, all of the installments within a series are connected with each other by the Desmond storyline: all of the enchanted worlds he travels to are just simulations achieved through using \"Animus\" — a particular device which gets in the DNA and allows its user to drive around their memories. \nThe game involves following mechanics — presuming the player to chase around some target, not moving to close, but not getting far at the same time; exploring quests — the heart of movement mechanics is parkour, and fighting — hero's arsenal involves swords, spears, and other melee weapons as well as ranged ones: bows, crossbows, and javelins.",

The problem is the player does not know how to do so — they start exploring the house, which is changing the layouts repeatedly and find out many jump-scares along the way.\nGetting through all of the six chapters the player may reach of the three endings: bad, average and good. The end is decided not by momentarily choice but by a series of decisions throughout the game. While the player is uncovering the truth about the premises of the hero's masterpiece, the DLC tells a story of his daughter which returns to her memories of the past.

    "description": "Darksiders III is the third installment in its series of dark fantasy action games. Plotwise, it is the series' spin-off rather than the sequel.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury's mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he's obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.",

    "description": "Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a stealth-action game developed by Ubisoft Toronto. It is the sixth main installment in the series.\n\n###Story\nThe game takes place six months after the events of Conviction. The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.\n\n###Gameplay\nSplinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.\n\nThe players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher's outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.\n\nThe game evaluates the players' performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies.",

    "description": "Street Fighter V is a fighting game, the fifth main installment in Capcom’s Street Fighter series.  \nStory\nThe game takes place between the events of Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III. The game features two story-oriented modes: Character Story and A Shadow Falls. In Character Story you can choose any character to go through a series of fights. It starts with a prologue and finishes with ending unique for each character. At launch only, Characters Story was available while A Shadow Falls, a full-fledged story mode that describes a battle between World Fighters and criminal syndicate Shandaloo was added later in July 2016.\nGameplay\nLike its predecessors, Street Fighter is a 2D one-on-one fighting game. The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character. Using these moves helps to fill V-Gauge which can be used to perform V-Reversals, special counter-attacks, or V-Trigger especially powerful abilities that require the full gauge.",

The demonic threat seems to have been forgotten, but the demons return, and there are new accidents around the world. Nero and Dante have parted ways, and Nero established his own agency. He also received a new robotic arm made by his engineer Nico. It replaces his Devil Bringer prosthetic that was stolen by a villain. At the beginning of the game, Nero rides his van to Red Grave City in which a demonic tree appeared. At the same time, Dante has a new client, a mysterious V, who hires him to investigate the demonic attacks.\nGameplay\nAs usual in the Devil May Cry series, the player controls his or her character from the third person view. The game features three playable characters. Dante and Nero make a return, and V is newly introduced. Each of the three characters has a unique fighting style. Nero's prosthetic hand allows him to use a variety of options, such as pulling his enemies closer. Nero also uses his legendary weapons, the gun called “Blue Rose” and the sword named “Red Queen”. Dante, as usual, fights with his swords Rebellion and Sparda, as well as a variety of new weapons, such as chainsaws and a motorcycle. V uses a walking cane as a weapon.",

    "description": "Starship Troopers - Terran Command is a thrilling real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers movies universe. Take command of the Mobile Infantry and do your part in the war against the Arachnid threat. Build, develop and control your armies to strike an effective balance between tactical superiority and strength in numbers. Ensure that human civilization, not insect, dominates the galaxy now and always!\nPlanetary Campaigns\nFight for control over an entire planet in the campaign mode, where the storyline and missions develop according to your choices and achievements on the battlefield. Remain obedient to the demands of Terran Command – no matter how costly or ruthless – to benefit from exclusive unit types and special abilities, or follow your own path to glory to become an irrefutable Hero of the Federation. Develop and customize your forces through a detailed technology tree and upgradeable leader characters that can be assigned to your units.\nTactics & Numbers\nWhile the Arachnids can rely on virtually limitless numbers, the Mobile Infantry must develop effective tactics to overcome this imbalance. Deploy your units at strategic locations to cover vital choke points and gain superior firepower through tactical use of elevation levels. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire also allow Bugs to lay ambushes around every corner, as they are well known for their use of surprise attacks and deception.\nUnits & Abilities\nAn expansive range of unique units, weapons, and special abilities are at the disposal of MI commanders. Infantry squads armed with Morita Assault Rifles and MX-90 Fragmentation Grenades form the mainstay of your forces. Rocket Troopers deliver deadly payloads with pin-point accuracy while Engineers are vital to shore up defensive positions with MG turrets, barricades, and minefields. As a campaign progresses, technological breakthroughs unlock the true potential of the Federation’s arsenal with Power Armor infantry squads, TAC Fighter airstrikes, Marauder mobile suits, and many more developments optimized for spraying Bug ichor across the battlefield.\nKey features\n- Dynamically generated campaigns for virtually limitless replayability.\n- Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.\n- Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight & True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.\n- An extensive technology tree to develop and customize your forces.\n- Persistent leaders can be attached to units and upgraded throughout the campaign.\n- Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.",

You play as Corvo Attano, Empress' bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player's choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.",

    "description": "Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game, a part of Nintendo’s Super Mario series. \nStory\nThe game follows Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach from her forced marriage with Bowser. The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy’s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. \nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.",

The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</b></i> is a 2007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> game developed and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation\">Valve</a>. Following <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One\">Episode One</a></i> (2006), it is the second of two shorter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_games\">episodic games</a> that continue the story of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\">Half-Life 2</a></i> (2004). The player controls <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a>, who travels through the mountains surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_17\">City 17</a> to a resistance base with his ally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyx_Vance\">Alyx Vance</a>. Like previous <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)\">Half-Life</a></i> games, <i>Episode Two</i> combines shooting, puzzle-solving and narrative elements, and adds expansive environments and less linear sequences.</p>\n\n<p><i>Episode Two</i> was released on October 10, 2007, for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows\">Windows</a> on Valve's distribution service <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)\">Steam</a>, and as a part of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box\">The Orange Box</a></i>, a compilation of Valve games for Windows, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a>. The PlayStation version was produced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts\">Electronic Arts</a>. <i>Episode Two</i> received positive reviews.</p>\n\n<p>Valve canceled <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_Three\">Half-Life 2: Episode Three</a></i> when they abandoned episodic development and began developing a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine\">game engine</a>. In 2020, after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreleased_Half-Life_games\">canceling several further <i>Half-Life</i> projects</a>, Valve released <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx\">Half-Life: Alyx</a></i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>As with previous <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)\">Half-Life</a></i> games, <i>Episode Two</i> is played in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games)\">first person</a> as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a> against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhuman\">transhuman</a> troops, known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_(Half-Life)\">Combine</a>, and other hostile alien creatures. Levels are linear but add a more open environment, consisting of puzzles and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> game-play. Sequences involving vehicles are interspersed throughout the game, breaking up moments of combat.</p>\n\n<p>One of the focal points was the increased use of vehicles in open areas. However, the game retains its original linear style until the final battle. <i>Episode Two</i> has more puzzles than <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One\">Episode One</a></i>; the sequence in which the player must cross a damaged bridge is the biggest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics\">physics</a> puzzle in the series. As in the previous two games, <i>Episode Two</i> features numerous \"achievements\" (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a>'s Trophies and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live\">Xbox Live</a>'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live\">Achievements</a>) for carrying out certain tasks. Some are essential to game progress, such as helping fight off an antlion invasion, or defeating the first Hunters. Others are optional tricks or feats the player can perform, such as killing a Combine soldier with their own grenade or running down a certain number of enemies with the car.</p>\n\n<h3>Enemies</h3>\n\n<p><i>Episode Two</i> featured a new Hunter enemy, which had just been seen briefly in a recorded message in <i>Episode One</i>. The Hunter serves as one of the most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyx_Vance\">Alyx Vance</a>. The Hunter is a powerful and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; <i>Episode Two</i>'s environments are designed with this in mind.</p>\n\n<p>An interview in the August 2006 issue of <i>PC Gamer</i> magazine revealed that the Hunter stands 8 feet (2.4 m) tall. Erik Johnson, the game's project lead, states that the Hunters are \"big and impressive, but they can go anywhere the player can go\", as the player can encounter them both indoors and outdoors. Ted Backman, senior artist for Valve, talks about how the Hunter can express emotions, being a somewhat non-human character. \"We want the Hunter to be able to express nervousness or aggression, [to show you] whether it's aggressive, hurt, or mad.\" Hunters are very aggressive and they tend to operate in packs, but can also be found supporting other Combine troops. Late in the game, they can be found escorting Striders, using their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flechette\">flechette</a> guns to protect the Striders that the player is trying to attack.</p>\n\n<p>Hunters primarily attack the player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If they do not strike a living target, the flechettes charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it. In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p><i>Episode Two</i> features no additions to Gordon Freeman's weapons inventory. Instead, Valve chose to further explore uses for the gravity gun, with which the player can pick up and throw large objects. They introduced more varied gravity gun \"ammunition\", such as logs, flares, and half-height butane tanks, which are easier to aim than full-size fuel drums.</p>\n\n<p>Near the end of the game, the player uses \"Magnusson Devices\", which designer Dario Casali described as a \"sticky bomb that you fire at a Strider's underbelly that will draw power from the Strider's internal power source\". The player uses the gravity gun to attach the bombs to tripodal enemy Striders; the bombs detonate when fired upon with any other of the player's weapons, instantly destroying the target. The Hunter escorts prioritize them as targets, either destroying them in the player's grasp or shooting already-attached ones off.</p>\n\n<p>Large sections of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Dodge_Charger\">1969 Dodge Charger</a>. It appears to have been tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman#Character_design\">Hazardous Environment suit</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_(Half-Life)\">Combine</a> have opened an interdimensional portal in place of the destroyed Citadel, to summon reinforcements and defeat the Resistance. Outside <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locations_of_Half-Life#City_17\">City 17</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyx_Vance\">Alyx Vance</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Dandridge\">Merle Dandridge</a>) escape the wreckage of a train they used to flee the city. The two proceed to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_communication_station\">transmission station</a>, where they make contact with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Isaac_Kleiner\">Dr. Isaac Kleiner</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Robins\">Harry S. Robins</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Eli_Vance\">Dr. Eli Vance</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Guillaume\">Robert Guillaume</a>), who have arrived at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locations_of_Half-Life#White_Forest\">White Forest</a> rocket facility. Kleiner and Eli learn that a copied Combine transmission Alyx is carrying may be able to close the portal. The pair reach an abandoned mine, where Alyx is critically wounded by a Combine Hunter. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortigaunt\">vortigaunt</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Todd\">Tony Todd</a>) leads the two to an underground outpost, where Gordon is instructed to help gather <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva\">larvae</a> from a nearby antlion colony to heal Alyx. After the larvae are gathered, vortigaunts begin to heal Alyx. With their abilities diverted, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Half-Life#G-Man\">G-Man</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shapiro_(actor)\">Michael Shapiro</a>) can now connect to Gordon. He reveals that he rescued Alyx from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility\">Black Mesa</a> Incident despite objections from an unspecified third party, and it is imperative she reaches White Forest. The G-Man instructs an unconscious Alyx to tell Eli to \"prepare for unforeseen consequences\".</p>\n\n<p>After Alyx recovers, they reunite with Eli, Kleiner and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Half-Life#Dog\">Dog</a> at White Forest and are introduced to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Arne_Magnusson\">Dr. Arne Magnusson</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aylward\">John Aylward</a>). The scientists are preparing a rocket which they plan to use with the code to reverse the portal. After Gordon subdues a Combine attack on the facility, Alyx gives Kleiner a message recorded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Half-Life#Judith_Mossman\">Judith Mossman</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Forbes\">Michelle Forbes</a>), which contains the location of the <i>Borealis</i>, a vanished <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locations_of_Half-Life#Aperture_Science_Laboratories\">Aperture Science</a> research vessel. Kleiner believes the vessel contains technology capable of combating the Combine, but Eli argues the vessel should be destroyed. Both agree that Alyx and Gordon should travel to the ship and locate Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, troubling him. Gordon learns from Eli that the G-Man provided the test sample which caused the Black Mesa Incident, warning Eli with the same message as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.</p>\n\n<p>While the scientists prepare the launch, White Forest is under another Combine attack. Gordon defeats the attackers using explosive weaponry created by Magnusson. The scientists launch the rocket and close the portal, trapping all remaining Combine forces on Earth. As Alyx and Freeman prepare to leave for the <i>Borealis</i>, Eli warns Gordon about the ship's \"cargo\". The trio head to a hangar to board a helicopter, but two Combine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_(Half-Life)#Advisors\">Advisors</a> suddenly appear and restrain them. Eli is killed by an Advisor before Dog can chase the Advisors away. Alyx, sobbing, clutches her father's body.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p><i>Episode Two</i> was the second in a planned trilogy of shorter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_games\">episodic games</a> that would continue the story of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\">Half-Life 2</a></i> (2004). It was developed simultaneously with <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One\">Episode One</a></i> (2006) by a team led by David Speyrer. This schedule of simultaneous development aided them in streamlining the story between the two games to create an immersive story. The technology used was the same for both games, allowing the development teams to quickly fix any technical problems that might arise from either game; this happened often because of the multi-platform release. The team originally planned the ending to feature a comical sequence with Lamarr, Kleiner's pet headcrab, floating in space outside the rocket Gordon launches into space; however, Valve president <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell\">Gabe Newell</a> requested killing off a major character to create a cliffhanger for <i>Episode Three</i>.</p>\n\n<p>On July 13, 2006, Valve announced that <i>Episode Two</i> would be released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in addition to Windows. Valve handled the development for the PC and Xbox 360, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts\">Electronic Arts</a> (EA) worked on the PlayStation 3 version. It was announced on September 7, 2007, that the PlayStation 3 version would be delayed because the EA studio behind the game was in the United Kingdom, away from Valve's development team, and therefore lagged behind in its schedule. According to Valve's marketing director, Doug Lombardi, the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows versions would be identical in functionality and performance.

On <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>, it has an average score of 90 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". As part of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box\">The Orange Box</a></i> compilation, <i>Episode Two</i> shared with <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)\">Portal</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2\">Team Fortress 2</a></i> in winning \"Computer Game of the Year\" at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Annual_Interactive_Achievement_Awards\">11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Adams of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> rated the game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its improved visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: \"Any way you look at it, <i>Episode Two</i> stands out, even among the <i>Half-Life</i> series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-tech.net\"><i>Bit-tech</i></a> awarded the game a ten out of ten score, citing approval of how the story turns and the introduction of side stories and new characters. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1UP.com\">1UP.com</a></i> said that it was \"vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Gamer_UK\">PC Gamer UK</a></i> felt that <i>Episode Two</i> was \"the most sumptuous chapter of the <i>Half-Life</i> saga, and by a country mile\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times\">The New York Times</a></i> enjoyed the gameplay, saying that battles \"often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes\".</p>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_Video_Games\">Computer and Video Games</a></i> said that, although the Source engine was dated, the \"wonderful art design and the odd bit of technical spit-shine ensure that <i>Episode Two</i> [...] doesn't lose any of its wow factor\". They also noticed that the game \"goes about fixing a lot of the niggling complaints we had about <i>Episode One</i>,\" applauding the open forests and rocky hills. The <i>New York Times</i> wrote that \"while it sows a few seeds for the final episode of the trilogy, the game lacks the driving force of the previous episode\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy\">GameSpy</a></i> felt that it was less consistent than its predecessors, and that the opening segments were \"arguably the weakest\".</p>\n\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_Three\">Half-Life 2: Episode Three</a></i> was scheduled for release by Christmas 2007.

In November 2024, Valve delisted <i>Episode One</i> and <i>Two</i> from the Steam Store and incorporated them into <i>Half-Life 2</i>.</p>\n\n<p>In reference to the <i>Episode Two</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_(video_games)\">achievement</a> \"Little Rocket Man\", which requires the player to carry a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_gnome\">garden gnome</a> from the start to the end of the game and place it into a rocket before it launches into orbit, Newell partnered with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wētā_Workshop\">Wētā Workshop</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab\">Rocket Lab</a> to create and launch a garden gnome on their \"Return To Sender\" space mission.

    "description": "<p><i><b>Arknights: Endfield</b></i> is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game\">action role-playing game</a> developed by the Chinese developer Hypergryph, published by them in China, and published elsewhere by its international division, Gryphline. It is a spinoff of Hypergryph's 2019 tower defense game <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights\">Arknights</a></i>. The game was released on January 22, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and mobile devices.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p><i>Arknights: Endfield</i> is a real-time 3D <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game\">action role-playing game</a> with strategic elements. Unlike the original <i>Arknights</i>, which features <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense\">tower defense</a> mechanics, <i>Endfield</i> introduces a semi-open world experience with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_and_management_simulation\">base-building and strategic management elements</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The core mechanism of combat is the combo skill system. Players control a four-member team simultaneously, with the ability to seamlessly switch between characters during battle, each possessing unique skills and abilities. Combat operates through a semi-real-time system where players can switch control between different characters, utilizing skill combinations and tactical coordination to defeat enemies. The system includes multiple attack types: basic attacks, tactical skills, combo skills, and ultimate abilities. Basic attacks are further divided into normal attack, drop attack, dodge pursuit, and execution moves.</p>\n\n<p>The four-member team shares three skill gauges, and any operator can consume one to use a tactical skill. The skill gauges recharge over time, and operators not under direct control perform only basic attacks. Heavy hits from basic attacks can directly add segments to the skill gauge and increase enemy imbalance values. When an enemy's imbalance gauge fills completely, they enter an imbalanced state, taking increased damage and becoming vulnerable to execution attacks. This imbalanced state lasts temporarily before disappearing, requiring players to re-accumulate imbalance through strategic combat.</p>\n\n<h3>Base building and industrial management</h3>\n\n<p><i>Endfield</i> features a base-building system that combines exploration with resource management and aspects of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_simulation\">factory simulation</a>, similar to those found in games like <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio\">Factorio</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfactory\">Satisfactory</a></i>. Players harvest resources from remote mining nodes connected by custom <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_line\">ziplines</a>, refine and process materials at specific machines, and route them through conveyor belts for crafting. The system requires budgeting and routing electricity, assigning inputs and outputs, and managing various ore types. Developers aim for an adjustable 50:50 ratio between RPG elements and factory building portions, allowing players to customize their gameplay balance according to personal preferences. The base builder supplies progression items quickly, encouraging players to learn and develop their industrial complexes.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p><i>Arknights: Endfield</i> takes place on a moon called \"Talos-II\", and the player takes upon the role of the \"Endministrator\" of the titular \"Endfield Industries\" corporation.</p>\n\n<p>The moon Talos-II was colonized 152 years prior to the beginning of the game's story by pioneers from Terra, the planet that serves as the setting of the previous game, accessing it through a dimensional portal known as an \"Æthergate.\" This portal was destroyed approximately a century before the events of the game, leaving the Terran pioneers stranded on Talos-II. As a result, several concepts, factions and characters are reprised from <i>Arknights</i>, such as Originium, an energy-rich mineral enabling the use of special pseudo-magical abilities called \"Arts\" and \"Rhodes Island\", the pharmaceutical corporation which the player character belonged to in <i>Arknights</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly to Terra, Talos-II is a world of natural disasters known as \"Catastrophes\" and crises, most notably affected by a dangerous supernatural disaster called \"Corruption\", which causes distorted environments and abnormal physical phenomena in the affected areas. Much of Talos-II is a wilderness and no-man's land yet to be explored, and an endemic species of creatures called \"Aggeloi\" exist as the primary threat to civilization; while armed raiders known as \"Landbreakers\" live in the fringes of society making a living off scavenging and crime. The pioneers belong to different nations and organizations, cooperating and competing with each other on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>With the resumption of the exploration of the ruins by the major powers of Talos-II, the Protocol Recycling Department was rebuilt under the leadership of Endfield Industries' Superintendent Perlica. The Endfield Engineering Center has integrated a large number of prototype equipment from the Protocol Recycling Department and successfully developed the \"Automated Industry Complex\". In order to prove the reliability of the system's transmission technology, the Protocol Recycling Department chose \"Valley No. 4\", the most barren area of Talos-II, as its target, attempting to use it as the basis for its gradual exploration outwards.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022, Hypergryph opened user accounts for <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> and released a pilot trailer. A first technical test of the game on PC by prospective players took place in January 2024. Another limited beta test took place in January 2025. <i>Endfield's</i> released date was officially revealed at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards_2025\">The Game Awards 2025</a> and was released on January 22, 2026.</p>\n\n<p><i>Endfield</i> uses a modified version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)\">Unity engine</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Marketing</h3>\n\n<p>On March 10, 2022, Hypergryph opened official accounts for <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> on various social media platforms. On March 16, a teaser trailer PV was released, and a multilingual official website was announced. Players could pre-register for the game on the official website. The image on the back of the website showed a countdown of 48:00:00, indicating that the official game PV would be released in two days. On March 18, a new concept CG and an initial gameplay demonstration video were released. The CG provided voice acting in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean, and it was announced that <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> would be a real-time strategy role-playing game.</p>\n\n<p>A year and a half later, on October 25, 2023, the official game account released a promotional image hinting at new information to be released, and the next day released a \"Technical Test\" PV, announcing that the technical test would begin in mainland China on November 10, 2023. On December 8, 2023, the PV was released at the 2023 Game Awards, announcing that the game would be launched on the PS5 platform, and that the technical test would begin globally on January 12, 2024. In August 2024, the game obtained a publication license from the State Press and Publication Administration.</p>\n\n<p>On December 14, 2024, the official game released a PV for the \"Second Test\", announcing that the second test would be launched in mid-January 2025. The test was conducted from January 17 to February 17, 2025. Subsequently, on April 28, 2025, the official announced the launch of player recruitment for the \"Second Test\" of the mobile version of <i>Arknights: Endfield</i>. The test was a confidential test, and the recruitment event lasted until 23:59 on May 11, 2025.</p>\n\n<p>In September 2025, Apple showcased the gameplay of the mobile version of <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> at its iPhone 17 Pro launch event and revealed in a press release after the event that the game would be launched in early 2026. On October 31 of the same year, the game publisher Griffin Frontier and the developer Hengxing Mountain Studio announced the launch of the \"Beta Test II\" player recruitment event for the game, and stated that the test would be launched on November 28 of the same year on PC, iOS and Android platforms.</p>\n\n<p>On December 12, 2025, Hypergryph officially announced that the game would launch its global open beta on January 22, 2026, confirming the expected release date previously revealed by Apple, and it was launched on PS5, PC, iOS, Android and other platforms on the same day.</p>\n\n<p>On January 16, 2026, Hypergryph held a preview live stream of <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> and broadcast it on multiple platforms simultaneously, officially confirming that the game will be launched globally on all platforms on January 22, and also released the launch PV.</p>\n\n<p>On the day of its launch, <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> players who connected their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal\">PayPal</a> accounts reported that their accounts were making payments of various amounts in different currencies, presumably microtransactions made by other players. In response, Hypergryph disabled the PayPal functionality and refunded all purchases.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p>According to review aggregator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>, <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> received \"mostly positive\" reception; in 14 reviews compiled by review aggregator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic\">OpenCritic</a>, the positive reviews account for 77%. <i>GamingBolt</i> reviewer Ravi Sinha gave the game an overall rating of \"good\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGamer\">TheGamer</a></i> reviewer Harry Alston believed that although the game has excellent visuals and character design, it is \"more style than content\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> commentator Sarah Thwaites said that there is more to explore in the game besides the \"login loop\", and that after about 20 hours of play, she would still be willing to continue exploring the character motivations, upgrades and \"more rewarding depth\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)\">Polygon</a></i> commentator Paulo Kawanishi believed that while the science fiction theme and base building bring a sense of novelty, it is not enough to make it stand out in the crowded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game\">gacha game</a> market.</p>\n\n<p>Reviews generally praised the visual and musical presentation of the game. Sinha praised its visual presentation and art style, the creation of sci-fi industrial scenes and the quality of music, and pointed out that although its semi-open areas are not a true open world, the content density is high and the exploration elements and side activities are plentiful. Thwaites also mentioned that its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk\">cyberpunk</a> visual background and atmosphere can immerse the player, and said that the battle performance after the later development is “visually attractive”. Kawanishi also highlighted the character models and smooth action combat to create an attractive sci-fi world view. <i>CGMagazine’s</i> Jordan Bioludi also affirmed the visual and musical presentation, believing that the overall content and system depth of the game exceeded his expectations for a gacha game. Alston affirmed the attractiveness of the character design, world view and scene and audiovisual presentation, but believed that its external texture failed to translate into enough gameplay and narrative support.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of gameplay structure and exploration, Sinha believed that the design of combining action role-playing, exploration and factory building/automation system is quite unique, and the factory building system is closely linked to the main gameplay, and the tutorial reduces the threshold for getting started. Thwaites pointed out that the game process mainly revolves around resource collection, simple environmental platform puzzles and area clearing, and unlocks base building and automation in the meta system; she believes that the content of puzzle-solving and area advancement is \"not particularly imaginative\", but it is still easy for players to be immersed for a long time under the vivid visual atmosphere. Bioludi praised the \"<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio\">Factorio</a></i>-like\" factory building/automation and the \"environmental engineering\" design in exploration as being interconnected, and pointed out that these mechanisms make exploration and building form a tighter cycle, citing zip lines, energy relays and puzzle devices as examples; he also mentioned that the game adds asynchronous shared construction similar to Death Stranding, making the world more connected. On the other hand, Kawanishi argued that while the base building and production system exists and appears complex, it is not \"critical\" enough in the narrative and main storyline progression. Many of its mechanisms are more like variations of similar game systems: for example, mining devices are similar to quick gathering/dispatch missions, ziplines become less important after fast travel is unlocked, and building elements such as power towers are often more like \"pieces of the puzzle to advance the campaign\". Alston also criticized the factory/automation system, although it appears complex, but in reality it is \"complex but not deep,\" involving a large amount of repetitive data collection. The refining process turns it into another form of wear and tear; he also pointed out game progress and character development rely excessively on time-consuming daily tasks and resource grinding. The new waiting period lacks a sense of reward and therefore does not respect the player's time.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the combat system, Biorudi affirmed that its action combat, centered around a four-person squad, is fast-paced and maintains a smooth but not overly complex rhythm through mechanisms such as perfect evasion, stance breakage, and chain attacks. Thwaites also called its combat \"glamour\" and had a distinct visual feedback, and praised the feel of switching members and connecting light attacks and special attacks to form combos. In contrast, Sinha criticized the combat for being repetitive and lacking tactical depth, often falling into a fixed style of play based on skill and combo cycles. Alston believed that the combat was long, boring, and highly repetitive, with enemies being tough but lacking a satisfying \"power growth\" feedback, and mentioned that cluttered screen information made dodging and parrying more frustrating. Kawanishi pointed out that although its action combat could support the world-building narrative atmosphere, it was still difficult to resolve the homogenization problem of the work within the gacha framework.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of narrative, Thwaites believed that the beginning was laid out with a lot of explanatory text, and the pacing was awkward. However, after players got through the dialogue-heavy beginning, the game gradually unfolded and made up for the shortcomings with atmosphere and combat performance. Biorudi praised the game's narrative scale and emotional presentation as being of a high standard, believing that it was friendly to new players and could provide more world-building information for fans of the series. However, he also pointed out that some narrative atmospheres were slightly incongruous, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">non-player characters</a> (NPCs) praising the protagonist excessively, and that the general NPCs had a rather standardized appearance. Sinha criticized the low plot tension, the sometimes dragging narrative pace, and the stiff dialogue (some information was repeatedly explained), and believed that the protagonist's characterization was not distinctive enough. Kawanishi pointed out that the work can provide space for reflection on technology and ethics, but its \"thought-provoking story goals\" and card-based structure are difficult to reconcile, resulting in insufficient overall recognizability. Alston also said that the narrative concept itself is interesting, but it is dragged down by a lot of explanatory dialogue and clichéd villain tropes.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding payment and system complexity, Thwaites mentioned that the game includes a large amount of currency and resource systems, and has a paid battle pass to accelerate development; she said that she has not encountered strong obstacles to payment in the short term, but still believes that it remains to be seen whether it will create pressure to \"have to spend money\" in the later stages. Biorudi pointed out that there are still multiple currencies in the game, but the overall paid economic design is not confusing or overly annoying; Alston emphasized that the game still lacks substantial depth to support long-term investment due to the stacking of multiple systems, with impressions of \"numerous menus\" and \"tutorial bombardment\". In addition, Alston also mentioned that the game includes a tower defense mode, but its experience is more like additional content and has not yet shown enough depth to support the overall experience.</p>\n\n<h3>Charts</h3>\n\n<p>Before the game's public beta, the official game company announced that <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> had over 35 million pre-registrations worldwide. On the first day of the public beta, <i>Arknights: Endfield</i> ranked 2nd on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)\">iOS App Store's</a> free app chart. The game was downloaded over 1 million times on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Store\">Google Play Store</a>.</p>\n\n",

Infinite continues the story of Master Chief and his companions, the Blue Team, as they fight against the AI called Cortana that tries to take over the control of the Halos. AHalo Infinite is set on a forested Halo inhabited by rhinos and other wildlife reminiscent of prehistoric Earth.\nModes\nIn addition to single player story campaign, Halo Infinite supports cooperative multiplayer modes, both local and online.

Are there other victims, or are you alone in your tiny plight? There are so many questions that need answering - but don't worry about that right now...that squirrel is looking pretty hungry.\nWith SMALLAND, the survival genre gets a tinier take that lets you appreciate the little things. Or flee in terror of the little things. The slightest breeze can sweep your items or even your house away from you. The simplest rainfall can form puddles the size of lakes in a matter of minutes.\nThere's an adventure out there waiting for you when you're small - a new world full of challenges to conquer and ecosystems to explore. Though take care, for this world is as dangerous as it is amazing. You'll need to keep your wits about you and craft tools to keep yourself alive in this new world. But with the help of your friends, you don't have to do it alone.\nKey Features\nIf simply experiencing the world from a new perspective is what you want, you can admire a breathtaking sunset or experience the beauty of nature from an all-new perspective in peaceful mode.\nBeing this small opens up brand new places you could never dream of going at your normal height. Protip: don't go into the sewer when it's raining.\nThe world of nature is about the struggle of survival. At this size you are no longer above this struggle. Every animal in this ecosystem is trying to get from day to day, and it does not matter to them if you do anything or not. Ants take food for their colony, cats hunt mice, life goes on.\nA problem we've seen in a lot of survival games is that there isn't enough symbiotic interaction with the world. It could rain for days, and it doesn't affect much more than your mood.\nBut at this miniscule size, involved interaction with the world around you is all but unavoidable. You can't ignore rain or snow anymore.\nIn SMALLAND, the little things make all the difference.",

    "description": "Crusader Kings II is a global RTS which takes place in the Middle Ages of Europe. The players will govern a house of nobility of that time, and ensure that its heritage will last for centuries. The second installment of the series fills the gap in the developer’s continuum of global strategies, allowing for lengthy grand campaigns and world conquests.\nThe main points of interest in the game are your noble house, holdings, and vassals. Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households, sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families, forge documents and declare wars. However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.",

The scientific progress has come, bringing new machines, factories, firearms, gaslight, steampunk aesthetics and a new way of life. And the Industrial Revolution is about to provoke the actual revolution. Too many people in the kingdom are not content with the changes and are about to overthrow the current king, who is also the main character's brother. Unlike the previous game, you are an aristocrat from the very beginning. It is up to you to take action and save your homeland this way or another, and it depends on you if your character is remembered as a wise and just leader or an evil tyrant.\nThe plot is non-linear, so the player's actions and decisions can influence not only other characters' perception of him but also the world in general. Compared to Fable II, social interactions with NPC became simpler and more straightforward. It is usually enough to be nice to people to make them like you, or even fall in love with you. To make an engagement, however, you will have to complete certain quests.",

Incessant warfare in Tarkov has sparked massive panic; the local population has fled the city, but those who stayed are looking to improve their fortunes at the expense of others. Having accepted the new reality, savage Tarkov locals - \"Scavs\" flocked into well-armed gangs and started the redivision of the city. Nowadays, Tarkov is separated by unseen borders, controlled by different groups. Gain-greedy gunmen would go to any length to have their way, including the murder of civilians and direct confrontation with the two private military companies.\nThe players will have to experience living in the skin of one of the mercenaries who survived the initial stage of the Tarkov conflict. After choosing one of the sides – USEC or BEAR – the player’s character starts to make his way out of the city. Tarkov is sealed off by UN and Russian military, supply chains are cut, communication with operational command is lost, and in these conditions everyone has to make his own choices of what to do and how to get out of the chaos-ridden metropolis",

    "description": "Arma 3 is an open-world tactical shooter with RPG elements and a heavy focus on realism. The game is set on fictional Greece-themed islands in the near future during the war between NATO and Iran. In the campaign mode you take on the role of Corporal Ben Kerry, who takes part in this conflict. There are three chapters in the campaign but you can complete separate missions during the multiplayer mode.\n\nArma’s key feature is its realistic battles. It’s not another military shooter where you can get an upgraded gun and go kill dozens of enemies. Instead, the game suggests you feel like a real soldier with all dangers and difficulties you can experience. That’s why you need to think over your tactics and protection, be patient and ready for long runs. Arma 3 provides you with a great amount of weaponry suitable for your playstyle.\n\nArma 3 is the third main installment in the series. It’s a follower to ARMA: Armed Assault, ARMA 2 and their multiple DLCs, and is extended with nine expansions.",

    "description": "Quake 4 is a first-person shooter developed by Raven Software, the fourth installment in the series and the first Quake game not developed by id Software. \nPlot\nStorywise, Quake 4 is a sequel to Quake 2 and continues the story of the war between humans and cyborg alien race Strogg. You play as a Marine Corporal Matthew Kane, a member of elite Rhino Squad. The squad participates in the invasion on Strogg's home planet, but their spacecraft gets crushed in the middle of the battle zone. Now the protagonist must reunite with his team and finish the mission.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay shares many similarities with previous entries in the series, however this time, the game is much more single-player focused. The single-player mostly consists of fighting with aliens in different locations on foot with occasional differences such as turret sections or mech missions. One of the most notable differences in the game comparing to the rest of the series is that most of the time you are accompanied by the squadmates that help you fight enemies. The player has 12 weapons to choose from, most of which are recurring from the previous games such as nailgun, shotgun, railgun, blaster.\nThe multiplayer includes six different game modes: Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena Capture the Flag and DeadZone.",

Up to 72 players can share a server at which they participate in races together. They can also purchase in-game homes, which allow the players to unlock faster cars and driver perks. The drivers are customizable up to their clothing and emotions.\nWeather and seasons\nForza Horizon 4 has a dynamic change of weather and seasons that change on a weekly basis. The weather conditions are synchronized and shared by all players on the same server. The weather and seasons alter the environment and thus the gameplay. Conditions like snow, mud, and ice can influence not only the driving style but also which areas and routes are accessible during which season. Most notably, the players can drive on the ice when lakes and rivers freeze. \nCars\nForza Horizon 4 features more than 450 vehicles that are licensed by over one hundred car manufacturers. Among the few notable manufacturers that were not included because of licensing problems are Toyota and Lexus.\nModes\nAlthough the game is oriented towards online multiplayer gameplay, it also has a single player and local multiplayer modes.

However, it will be more accurate to say that the game is closer to the cinematic version of this story, created by director Peter Jackson. This is noticeable both in the visual solutions of some locations, and in the events themselves and their location in time relative to each other.\n\nJudging by the events, the game takes place between the events of the books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\".

This system provides a change in the world of the game and its inhabitants from the actions of the player. Therefore, each passage differs from other p",

    "description": "Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure open-world game developed by Ubisoft Montreal. It is the second installment in the series and continues the main idea of its predecessor - hacking and hacktivism in an open world.\n\nWelcome to San-Francisco. It is the second city in the United States to install the city-wide operating system named ctOS, which connects everything from your car to your smart home to a global network. Marcus Holloway is tagged by the system as a suspect for a crime he did not commit. Marcus decides to take action and gets together with the hacktivist group DedSec to expose ctOS and its creators.\n\nWD2 offers the player an immense open world which consists of San-Francisco, Oakland, Marin and Silicon Valley. It's the player's choice to navigate the world on foot or on a wide range of vehicles from cars to boats.\n\nIt is up to the player to choose whether to use a lethal or non-lethal approach on a mission as there is always a taser in your inventory and a billiard ball attached to a paracord that knocks enemies out. \n\nIt is possible to hack into any devices that are connected to ctOS. For instance, Marcus can control forklifts, buzz guards phones in order to distract them.",

    "description": "Forza Horizon 3 is a racing open-world game developed by Playground Games. It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.",

Fortunately, the labyrinth's endlessness extends to its resources as well.  Utilize all your blacksmithing skills to craft a legendary weapon and make your escape!The labyrinth is endless. Only a weapon with great power can be the key to escaping this labyrinth.A repetitive forging process is necessary to create a good weapon.Hammering iron at high temperatures makes the weapon more resistant to strong impacts.Stretching, cutting, and rejoining the iron increases the weapon's flexibility, making it less likely to break.Quenching the heated iron in water ensures the blade remains sharp for longer.Fortunately, this labyrinth is rich in resources. Chop wood to make charcoal and use it as fuel for the furnace. Mining stone may yield ore that can be smelted into fine iron bars. Discovering ore with good properties allows you to smelt it into iron bars, which can then be forged into more powerful weapons.You can't always be working. Even in a labyrinth, you have the right to enjoy your leisure time. You can race with animals, test the performance of your crafted weapons, or even make some pretty friends in the labyrinth.",

In a war-torn world of Cairn, humanity is close to extinction. Cairn became a battleground for two extra-terrestrial forces - the Aetherials and Chthonians. Both of which are eager to completely wipe out humanity for different reasons. The game tells us a story of several humans that try to adapt and survive the harsh times.\nLike in most Action RPGs, the main focus of the game is put on battling the enemies and gathering loot - armor, potions, weapons, and gold. Grim Dawn features a crafting system that is similar to the one in a popular mod DoTA. The developers put a strong emphasis on the enhanced physics in the game, environmental kills, enemies dismemberment and a totally new mission system. \nThe players are free to choose one of eight classes present in the game. Several factions are also featured. As the plot progresses, the player will have to choose which factions to join. Joining one faction will make the opposing one hostile to the protagonist.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2</b></i> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter\">tactical shooter</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game\">video game</a> developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Paris\">Ubisoft Paris</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Storm_Entertainment\">Red Storm Entertainment</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft\">Ubisoft</a>. It was released for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable\">PlayStation Portable</a>. It is the sequel to <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_Advanced_Warfighter\">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</a></i>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Voltage_Software\">High Voltage Software</a> developed the game's PlayStation Portable version, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grin_(company)\">Grin</a> developed the Windows version.</p>\n\n<p>The game takes place in 2014, immediately after the events of <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</i> (<i>GRAW</i>), just south of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico–United_States_border\">Mexico–United States border</a>, and focuses on the conflict between a Mexican rebel group, Mexican loyalists, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army\">U.S. Army</a> in the span of 72 hours. A wide array of location types are included, featuring mountains, small towns, urban environments, and a large hydro-electric dam.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>Much of the gameplay remains similar to its predecessor; the combat focuses on the player doing the bulk of the fighting, while relying on tactical combat instead of arcade-style shooting to overcome opponents. As with the previous game, weapons featured in the game are either based on actual models (such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_SCAR\">FN SCAR</a>) or are hypothetical prototypes, with the player able to command friendly units assigned to help them, from their own squad, to drones, tanks and aircraft. Like its predecessor, two different versions exist; while both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions are essentially similar, the Microsoft Windows version features many gameplay differences to these versions. In addition, a new and improved gameplay element is introduced - Crosscom 2.0 - as well as new weapons (including sub-machine guns for secondary weapons), the ability to have a medic in the squad, and new friendly units to control, including a two-man squad of Loyalist troops, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunctional_Utility/Logistics_and_Equipment_vehicle\">MULE Drone</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD_Helicopters_MH-6_Little_Bird\">Little Bird</a> attack helicopter, and Far Support (Airstrikes for consoles, Mortar/Artillery Support for Microsoft Windows).</p>\n\n<h3>Crosscom 2.0</h3>\n\n<p>Crosscom 2.0 is an improvement on the original system introduced from the previous game, giving players more direct involvement in a combat situation as well as more control over friendly units. The most significant improvement to this is an information interlink between all friendly units, which now allows players to get a full screen view of what any unit is seeing. Furthermore, players can use this perspective to plan out orders for units and even directly control the movement of some units as well, such as the MULE.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the gameplay is similar to that of the Xbox 360 version of <i>GRAW</i>, although some new features, like <i>Eternal Eyes</i>, have been added to improve gameplay, making the direction of friendly units more accurate and effective. The squad A.I. has also been improved, with squad members actively seeking cover and descriptively calling out targets.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the gameplay plays out differently to that of the console iterations, and more similarly to the original <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_(2001_video_game)\">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a></i>, but remains largely similar to the Microsoft Windows version of <i>GRAW</i>, in that players play in a first-person perspective, must micro-manage team mates with greater use of squad tactics, and have more situation awareness. Developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grin_(company)\">Grin</a> and built on their proprietary engine called \"Diesel 2.0\", only a few in-game assets such as voice-overs and Cross-Com and Narcom videos remain the same. While some of the missions featured are similar in objective structure to those of the console version, they play out in a completely different manner.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the first <i>GRAW</i>, players in the online multiplayer mode can be \"downed\", or critically injured, instead of killed. This gives teammates the opportunity to heal a downed teammate and prevent the other team from getting the point, although downed players can be shot and killed by players from the opposing team before they are healed. Characters can now \"slide\" into a crouched position while running, just like in the first <i>GRAW</i>. The ability to use cover like in the singleplayer mode is absent in the multiplayer mode. The player can choose from four weapon classes: Rifleman, Grenadier, Automatic Rifleman, and Marksman, each with its own bonus; for example choosing the rifleman class makes the player more proficient with rifles, the automatic rifleman more proficient with machine guns, and so on. Another new feature added to multiplayer is full-screen cross-com; as in singleplayer mode, the player can hold down a button and bring up the fullscreen view. This can be used to view friendly players' views as well as the Drone, but cannot be used to give commands or manually fly the drone.</p>\n\n<p>Games are created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live\">Xbox Live</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network\">PlayStation Network</a> users and can be up to 16 players. Split Screen is available on the console versions, which supports up to four players.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the defeat of Carlos Ontiveros and Aguila 7 following a deadly coup in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City\">Mexico City</a>, destabilization in Mexico continues and spreads across <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America\">Latin America</a>, to the point that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal\">Panama Canal</a> is closed due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency\">insurgency</a>. Captain Scott Mitchell and his Ghost team are given orders to return to Mexico, where rebels led by Juan de la Barrera are believed to be planning an attack on the United States from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Juárez\">Ciudad Juárez</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)\">Chihuahua</a>, possibly with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bomb\">dirty bomb</a>. Due to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress\">U.S. Congress</a> refusing further military action and treaty boundaries between Mexico and the U.S., the Ghosts are deployed covertly and largely on their own, at least until U.S. military support can be authorized.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell's Ghost team deploys outside Ciudad Juárez to assist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Army\">Mexican Army</a> loyalists led by Colonel Jimenez in attacking rebel positions. During the fighting, General Joshua Keating and Lieutenant Barnes learn that de la Barrera has acquired three smuggled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine\">Ukrainian</a> Red Star IV nuclear warheads, which he plans to mount to stolen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan\">Pakistani</a> Kashmira-II to use against the U.S.. The joint Ghost–loyalist force continue to operate against the rebels, but after securing a heavily defended supermarket, a warhead detonates in the supermarket's basement, killing many of Jimenez's men and irradiating the area.</p>\n\n<p>With the warheads now confirmed to be in Ciudad Juárez, the Ghosts and Jimenez's remaining forces rescue a Mexican journalist for information on de la Barrera and the other warheads, but their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk\">Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk</a> is shot down by mercenaries and Mitchell's team is forced to leave Lieutenant Rosen behind. The team fights their way to another extraction helicopter, but Barnes reveals that the rebels managed to secure the crash site, retrieve the Black Hawk wreckage, and capture Rosen, which the U.S. government fears they will use to expose American involvement and twist it to garner support for the rebellion. Keating tasks Mitchell's team with raiding a hacienda, where they successfully destroy the wreckage and recover Rosen, leaving the rebels without evidence.</p>\n\n<p>After Mitchell's team returns from the hacienda raid, U.S. President Ballantine and Mexican President Ruiz-Peña sign the North American Joint Security Agreement, authorizing a formal U.S. military intervention into Mexico. The Ghosts use the rescued journalist's information to track down a warhead and kill de la Barrera, but they are unable to recover the other warhead. Reports eventually arrive of an attack on a dam in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas\">El Paso, Texas</a>, and Barnes realizes they are targeting a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_defense\">ballistic missile defense</a> installation beneath the dam to disable American nuclear defenses and use the last warhead as leverage to force them out of Latin America. Ballantine, unwilling to bring war to the American border, tasks the Ghosts with finding the last warhead. With heavy support, the Ghosts head back into Mexico to stop the nuclear threat. Mitchell guides an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse\">EMP strike</a> to neutralize the last warhead, which succeeds but seriously wounds him in the process. Mitchell is recovered by Rosen, while Keating and Ballantine congratulate him for his efforts.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of the game were favorable upon release, although the Windows version of the game got lower scores than the console versions.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameRankings\">GameRankings</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a> gave it a score of 86.59% and 84 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 86.46% and 86 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 77.15% and 76 out of 100 for the PC version; and 62.38% and 61 out of 100 for the PSP version.</p>\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Annual_Interactive_Achievement_Awards\">11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, <i>Advanced Warfighter 2</i> received a nomination for \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_Audio_Design\">Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design</a>\" by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_&amp;_Sciences\">Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As of April 26, 2007, <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2</i> has sold 1 million copies on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>. It was also named Game of the Month by <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer\">Game Informer</a></i> for May 2007.<sup>[<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></i>]</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Controversy</h3>\n\n<p>Controversy surrounded the game when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_president_of_Juárez\">Mayor of Ciudad Juárez</a>, Héctor Murguía Lardizábal, criticized the game for trying to scare tourists away from going to the town. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)\">Chihuahua</a>'s governor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Reyes_Baeza_Terrazas\">José Reyes</a> condemned the game for insulting Mexico and its people, calling on all authorities to seize the game if it were sold on Mexican soil.</p>\n\n",

    "description": "Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. \n\n###Plot\nThe plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both pr",

You play as Bob, a fully customizable character that travels from one dream to another. Bob has neither no background nor superpowers. His abilities don’t differ from yours: he can grab things, climb ledges and so on. \n\nEvery level consists of multiple puzzles that can be solved in different ways. You can push and pull carts, break walls and interact with everything else comparable to your own size. The game heavily focuses on physics. Puzzles’ solutions are intuitive and make you act like in real life. In their core levels are quite linear: you need to reach the door at another side of the location to get into the next dream. While at the first levels you need to find exits from tiny rooms, the further you go, the larger locations become. There is a lot of content in the game in general, and it clearly references the sandbox genre where you can do almost everything you want.",

Highly detailed facial animation allows players to detect the exact emotion witness or suspect is expressing, and it can become a leading hint in a case. Slow and meticulous crime solving is broke up by fast-paced action scenes including car chases, gunfights and hand to hand combat.\nAfter every case player’s performance will be graded by 1-5 star rating, depending on how they acted during interrogations and how well they searched for the clues.

    "description": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with an open world. The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.\nThe main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.\nThe worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.",

The Cataclismo.\nBuild and defend the towers and walls of a besieged humanity struggling to live in a world blighted by a dangerous mist. Generations have grown to withstand the tide of pale monsters that lurk in the haze below the last human city. But the Horrors are getting stronger. Guide an expedition into the ruins of a forgotten kingdom and reclaim our world, in this fortress-building real-time strategy game from the makers of Moonlighter and The Mageseeker. Rise above the Mist, and rebuild humanity stone by stone.\nBuild your stronghold\nPiece together walls, bridges, and towers with straightforward, brick-by-brick construction. The tougher your structures, the better you'll endure the relentless assault of the Horrors. Should your walls be razed or your barriers breached, fold time itself to give your soldiers another chance to survive.\nDefend against Horrors in an unforgiving realm\nA foul swarm threatens your efforts every night. Deploy skillful crossbowmen, blazing artillery, and brutal traps to fend off the monstrosities that rush your walls. But remember, what works in the fogs of the forest may not help in the downpour of the Mist Sea, or the terrible gloom of the Depths...\nPlan for tomorrow\nEven if you survive the night, the Mist endures, and the Horrors will return. Gather and manage stockpiles to prepare for what’s to come, and research new technologies in an RTS economy that will see you scouring the map for every mineral deposit and battered crate of salvage you can find.\nBring light to a shattered world\nFollow Iris, a promising scholar of the mystical Artes, as she walks the battlements of the last city, Ciudad Hogar. This quiet scholar holds the future of humanity close to her chest, in the small, glowing Perla that has been embedded in her body since she was found orphaned in the city streets.\nGet creative\nBuild intricate medieval castles freely in Creative Mode without worrying about your creations being destroyed by Horrors. Or plan rugged ramparts for your frontier encampments as you push into the unknown in the dark, medieval fantasy campaign.",

    "description": "The fourth installment of a popular series, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is split into two different, gameplay-wise, parts. The single-player campaign invites players to go through the episodic story, where players control six different characters. And even though the stories are taking place in different locations, the events of the campaign are happening simultaneously, creating the sense of urgency and painting a large-scale picture of the events.\r\nMultiplayer side of things in the Call of Duty series has been more popular among the players. A lot of features, not present in the single-player campaign, will be available to the player, such as a killstreak mechanic, that rewards players for killing multiple enemies without dying. Multiplayer maps consist of team-based and deathmatch based game modes, where players take on the objectives in order to complete the map mission or to obtain the largest amount of kills. Depending on how well the player does, they will be rewarded with experience points, which will allow them to level up and unlock new weapons, abilities, and perks for the playable classes.",

    "description": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

The world was heavily damaged by Aragami (荒神 “violent god”), mysterious monsters that consist of hundreds of thousands of semi-sentient single-celled organisms and are capable of adapting to the most extreme surroundings. The game follows a player made character that joins Fenrir, an organization that aims to exterminate Aragami using God Arcs, the weapon made from Aragami’s cells.  \nGameplay\nThe game consists of more than 100 missions that can be played both cooperatively or competitively. The goal of each mission is to slay specific enemies with the time limit.\nThe God Arc is the only weapon available to the player. However, it can transform into three different forms: blade, gun, and shield. The character has various moves such as dashing, jumping, sprinting as well as several types of attack. These moves and using God Arc in blade form consumes player’s stamina. Using gun mode, on the other hand, consumes Oracle Points that can be replenished by attacking enemies in blade mode. \nResurrection version\nThe remaster of the game named God Eater Resurrection was released 2016 for PS4, PS Vita and Windows. It features some new gameplay mechanics from God Eater 2, the most noticeable of which is new Predator mode for God Arc.",

    "description": "Something else we did:Have a look at another game we made that is already released: Treasure Hunter Simulator https://store.steampowered.com/app/748300/Treasure_Hunter_Simulator/\r\nHAVE A LOOK AT THESE GAMES FROM OUR FRIENDShttps://store.steampowered.com/app/849100/Alaskan_Truck_Simulator\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/992840/Car_Wash_Simulator\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/803980/Plane_Mechanic_Simulator\r\nAbout the GameGas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.\r\nBuy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of the broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy those that can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.\r\nThe more you widen your gas station’s appeal, the more customer demands will vary. The truckers want a healthy meal and a shower while the Tesla driver wants a Latte while he waits for his car to charge up. Expand the range of services you offer by adding stations, buildings and appropriate equipment. Why not expand and build a shop area, build a car wash station or even a small motel? How about some slot machines to ramp up the profits?\r\nRestoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built, ranging from your own color schemes, the name of your gas station to decorations inside and outside.\r\nDon’t forget to advertise! Letting people know about your existence and services you expand will drive even more customers to you. It might not come cheap, but pays for itself in the long run.\r\nServing your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up and their food served right away. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and closing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy.\r\nYou can try, but the more you expand the less likely that you will be able to manage it all on your own. Hire the right people to help you run your business, but keep a close eye on them. Some employees might just not do their job right, slack, lack the right attitude to serve customers or even steal.\r\nYou can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. You can also opt to increase your profits further by procuring from less reputable sources. Remember the gas truck that went missing last week the newspaper wrote about? Well, a shady character is just offering you a full gas delivery at half the price…\r\nOr maybe you want to take some shadier goods into your offer, the profit margins certainly are enticing.\r\nSometimes it just isn’t possible to keep every customer happy, some are just out to get you. Don’t worry, you have many stupid and mean things you can do to take revenge on such people. Drop their food, be extra slow to hand things over, shake their soda real good or just throw stuff at them. Dozens of ways to get back at those nasty ones. Just don’t overdo it, others might be watching.\r\nIrritating or shady customers, your staff breaking or stealing things or too much pressure are by far not the only situations you’ll have to deal with. You have a triving business and some people just want a piece of it. You will have to find means and ways to deal with robbery or extortion attempts not to mention vandalism or the occasional level of stupidity.Key FeaturesWide range of choices and approaches in every aspect of the game.\r\nExpansive feature set for renovation.\r\nin-depth features to expand and run your business.\r\nHigh level of customization in all areas.\r\nDetailed financial aspects of the entire operation.\r\nMore than 100 expansion and upgrade options.\r\nMore than 20 customer types and 50+ customers.",

As it turns out, a rogue group called Illuminati made it look like a proof for their instability and now augmented people are living like outcasts. \r\n\r\nWe follow Adam Jensen once again as he works as a double agent for Interpol and a hackers group called Juggernaut Collective to confront the Illuminati and reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nThe core gameplay of Mankind Divided hasn't changed much except minor changes like no need for batteries anymore because your energy bar slowly regenerates itself back and a non-killing politic. You can beat the game without killing anyone making Mankind Divided a big morality question for the player as he walks it through.",

También puedes abrazar tu corrupción interior como el Ansia Oscura, un héroe con un origen completamente personalizable con sus propias mecánicas e historia. Elijas a quien elijas, prepárate para vivir aventuras, saquear, combatir y vivir romances a lo largo y ancho de los Reinos Olvidados y más allá. Reúne al grupo. Disfruta de la aventura online con un grupo de hasta cuatro jugadores.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/An_expansive_original_story.png?t=1725654125\" /><br><br>Primero, te secuestran; luego, te infectan y, al final, te pierdes. Te estás convirtiendo en un monstruo, pero, a medida que la corrupción crece en tu interior, también crece tu poder. Ese poder puede ayudarte a sobrevivir, pero tendrás que pagar un precio. Con todo, tu mejor baza, más que cualquier habilidad, podrían ser los vínculos de confianza que establezcas con tu grupo. En medio de un conflicto entre diablos, deidades y siniestras fuerzas de otros mundos, juntos decidiréis el destino de los Reinos Olvidados.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Next_Gen_new.gif?t=1725654125\" /><br><br>En el corazón de Baldur's Gate 3 late el nuevo motor Divinity 4.0, que te ofrecerá una libertad sin precedentes para explorar, experimentar e interactuar en un mundo próspero repleto de personajes, peligros y engaños. Una grandiosa narrativa visual te acercará a los personajes más que nunca. Desde los bosques malditos por las sombras hasta las mágicas cavernas del Underdark, pasando por la propia ciudad en expansión de Puerta de Baldur... Tus acciones definirán la aventura, serán tus elecciones las que definirán tu legado. Pasarás a la historia.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/No_adventure_will_be_the_same.png?t=1725654125\" /><br><br>Los Reinos Olvidados son un mundo gigantesco, lleno de detalles y con una gran diversidad, en el que podrás descubrir secretos en cada rincón. La verticalidad es una parte esencial de la exploración. Ve con sigilo, lánzate al agua, empuja, trepa y salta, desde lo más profundo del Underdark hasta los resplandecientes tejados de Puerta de Baldur. Cada decisión que tomes servirá para que avance la historia, y todas ellas dejarán huella en el mundo. Define tu legado, alimenta las relaciones de amistad, gánate enemigos y resuelve los problemas a tu manera. No hay dos partidas iguales.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Modo multijugador online hasta para cuatro jugadores<br>Os permite combinar vuestras fuerzas en combate para atacar a los enemigos a la vez, o bien dividir el grupo para cumplir vuestras propias misiones y deseos. Trazad el plan perfecto todos juntos… o siembra el caos por tu cuenta cuando menos se lo esperen tus amigos. Las relaciones son complicadas; sobre todo, cuando tienes un parásito en el cerebro.<br><br></li><li>Personajes con origen<br>7 héroes con origen únicos que ofrecen una experiencia sumamente detallada y cuentan con rasgos, objetivos y puntos de vista sobre el mundo únicos. Sus historias se entrelazan con la narrativa general y tus elecciones determinarán si les espera la redención, la salvación, la dominación o algún otro de los muchos finales disponibles. Juega con un personaje con origen y disfruta de sus historias, o bien reclútalos para que luchen a tu lado.<br><br></li><li>Combate por turnos evolucionado<br>Basado en las reglas de la 5.ª edición de D&amp;D. Una iniciativa por equipos, ventaja y desventaja, y modificadores a las tiradas se combinan con una IA avanzada, interacciones con el entorno ampliadas y una mayor fluidez en combate que recompensa la estrategia y la previsión. Los tres ajustes de dificultad te permitirán personalizar el desafío del combate. Activa los dados trucados para ayudarte a prosperar en combate, o bien usa el modo Estratega para una experiencia más compleja.<br><br></li><li>Una profundidad sin precedentes<br>Cuenta con 31 subrazas además de las 11 razas (humano, githyanki, semiorco, enano, elfo, drow, tiefling, mediano, semielfo, gnomo, dracónido), con 46 subclases derivadas de las 12 clases. Los más de 600 conjuros y acciones ofrecen una libertad casi ilimitada a nivel de interactividad; todo ello en un mundo artesanal en el que se recompensa la exploración y la intervención del jugador define el viaje. Nuestro creador de personajes único cuenta con una profundidad sin precedentes a nivel de personajes, con reacciones que aseguran que, seas quien seas, dejarás un legado a tu paso hasta llegar al nivel 12. Las más de 174 horas de secuencias de vídeo te aseguran que, independientemente de las decisiones que tomes, la experiencia cinematográfica te acompañará en tu viaje. ¡Cada partida será un nuevo viaje cinemático!<br><br></li><li>Romances complejos y profundos<br>Con una incipiente amenaza de guerra cerniéndose sobre Puerta de Baldur y una invasión de azotamentes en el horizonte, será inevitable (aunque no necesario) forjar amistades por el camino. Lo que les pase dependerá de ti, ya que tendrás relaciones reales e intensas con la gente que conozcas en tu viaje. Cada compañero tendrá su propia brújula moral y reaccionará a las elecciones que tomes a lo largo del viaje. ¿A qué precio te ceñirás a tus ideales? ¿Permitirás que sea el amor el que determine tus acciones? Las relaciones creadas de camino a Puerta de Baldur propiciarán momentos de relajación en el campamento, pero también tendrán un gran peso en las numerosas decisiones que tomarás a lo largo de tu aventura.<br><br></li><li>Personaliza tu experiencia para los streamings<br>Así, cuando estés en directo, tu retransmisión no se verá interrumpida por un oso, una palabra malsonante o la ausencia de ropa interior. Baldur's Gate 3 tiene 3 niveles diferentes de personalización para streamers. Podréis desactivar los desnudos y el contenido explícito de forma independiente (o todo junto), así como también podréis activar la integración de Twitch para interactuar directamente con vuestro público, exactamente igual que hacemos en nuestras presentaciones de Panel From Hell. Gracias a estas opciones, podréis retransmitir Baldur's Gate 3 sin problemas, independientemente de vuestra forma de jugar.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Final_Image_new.gif?t=1725654125\" /></li></ul>ción.",

Todo capturado con asombroso detalle.<br>Total War: EMPIRE introduce multitud de nuevas características revolucionarias, entre las que se incluyen combates navales en 3D real. Por primera vez en la serie Total War, podrás dirigir de forma intuitiva un único barco o extensas flotas en paisajes marinos repletos de efectos meteorológicos y de agua extraordinarios que jugarán un gran papel en lo que acabará siendo tu glorioso triunfo o vergonzosa derrota.

    "description": "About DevelopersThe Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is the first game independently developed by our team. Despite our passion for the game, our lack of experience led us to blindly embark on a project of significant scale. Like blind men feeling an elephant, we learned and created simultaneously, encountering numerous challenges along the way. Many envisioned features proved unattainable, but fortunately, we managed to bring the game to completion.\nDue to our limited experience in various aspects such as combat, art, and level design, Our game does have some issues. It may not ultimately become a masterpiece that satisfies all players, but for us, the official launch of this work is a milestone achievement.\nWe sincerely thank players for your support and expectations. We are grateful for your companionship along this journey and are committed to continuing our efforts, striving not to disappoint your expectations.\nAbout the GameThe Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is a 3D action game inspired by traditional Chinese landscape ink paintings.You take on the role of a Qi army soldier, tasked with fighting back the Japanese pirate raids during the Ming Dynasty. After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty standing against the pirates – but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again.\nExplore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth!\nFighting against Japanese piratesThe Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback.\nAs a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat – and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates.\nInk and wash painting worldThe game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings. From the humblest blade of grass to the most majestic mountains of Fuling Island, each scene is beautifully painted in ink and wash. Its artistic design also draws inspiration from ancient Chinese paintings' character styles and proportions, providing players with a captivating visual experience.\nTactical melee with cold weaponsThe Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty will put your reflexes and warrior senses to the test. Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle.\nThe game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes.\nHistorical weaponry and armorThe game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from. Each piece of weaponry is meticulously recreated to reflect its origins in real historical contexts.\nYou can also disarm enemies and utilize their weapon skills against them. Through diligent practice, mastering the techniques of your adversaries, and then applying them to your own weaponry, you will become even more formidable in combat.",

Tus elecciones y posicionamientos marcarán el transcurso de los acontecimientos.<br />\n<br />\nUna nueva generación de puzles<br />\nEnfréntate a un amplio catálogo de puzles con diversos niveles de dificultad, incluidos ingeniosos metapuzles y puzles de oro dificilísimos. Puedes completar el juego sin resolver todos los puzles o bien luchar por las recompensas de dominarlos todos por completo. Contarás con nuevas habilidades como la manipulación de la gravedad, la telepatía, además de las mecánicas de la primera entrega de The Talos Principle. La experiencia será nueva, pero también familiar.<br />\n<br />\nUna odisea filosófica<br />\nAvanza en la trama de The Talos Principle y vive en primera persona una historia estimulante y sujeta a las acciones de los personajes con varios finales. La trama está firmada por guionistas que repiten como Jonas Kyratzes (The Eternal Cylinder, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos) y Tom Jubert (The Swapper, Subnautica), además de Verena Kyratzes (The Hand of Merlin, Serious Sam 4).<br />\n<br />\nUn mundo feliz<br />\nExplora más de doce entornos nuevos, desde una ciudad que está a punto de experimentar un cambio paradigmático a una isla misteriosa que alberga las claves del futuro. Y, entre puzle y puzle, podrás descansar y descubrir secretos históricos y sucesos olvidados.<br />\n<br />\nLas melodías de la creación<br />\nSumérgete en el intenso y agridulce mundo de The Talos Principle con una banda sonora impresionante compuesta por Damjan Mravunac (Serious Sam, The Talos Principle) con la colaboración especial de Chris Christodoulou (Risk of Rain 1 and 2).",

A professional hacker that can do anything that he pleases with the city due to a new electronic system that now controls almost every aspect of the city - ctOS. By using Aiden's phone, you are able to penetrate any device in the whole city and do whatever you want it. For example, you can hack through someone phone and rob his bank account, or gain control camera system and observe things around you. \n\nBut after one heist that goes wrong, Pierce must hide his family. But while riding to safety, his car is shot by a mercenary called Maurice Vega, and Pierce's niece dies. Interrogating Maurice did not lead to any clue who hired him, and when he returns in the city, he falls into a whole war between the hackers, involving his former partner Damien Brenks, hacking syndicate DedSec and other characters in the game. By blackmailing Aiden, he is forced to help the hackers in order to save his family.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Spider-Man 3</b></i> is a 2007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game\">action-adventure game</a> loosely based on the 2007 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_3\">of the same name</a>. The game is the sequel to 2004's <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2004_video_game)\">Spider-Man 2</a></i>, itself based on the 2004 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(film)\">of the same name</a>. It was released for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii\">Wii</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS\">Nintendo DS</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance\">Game Boy Advance</a> on May 4, 2007, and for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable\">PlayStation Portable</a> on October 16, 2007. Published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision\">Activision</a>, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch\">Treyarch</a>, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_Visions\">Vicarious Visions</a> handled the development of the other versions, which are drastically different. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beenox\">Beenox</a> ported Treyarch's version of the game to Microsoft Windows.</p>\n\n<p>The game plays similarly to two of Treyarch's previous <i>Spider-Man</i> titles, <i>Spider-Man 2</i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>, incorporating an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world\">open world</a> design that allows players to freely explore a fictitious representation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\">Manhattan</a> when not completing missions to advance the narrative. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)\">symbiote</a> costume from the film is a major gameplay mechanic, increasing Spider-Man's strength and unlocking new abilities. While the game directly adapts the plot of the film, it builds upon it by including additional characters and elements from the Spider-Man comic books and other aspects of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe\">Marvel Universe</a>. Most actors reprise their roles from the film, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire\">Tobey Maguire</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franco\">James Franco</a> (the first time he does so as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Keaton\">Josh Keaton</a> provided Harry's voice in the previous two games), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topher_Grace\">Topher Grace</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Haden_Church\">Thomas Haden Church</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons\">J. K. Simmons</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Campbell\">Bruce Campbell</a>, who played a French <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maître_d'\">maître d'</a> in the film, narrates the game's tutorial level.</p>\n\n<p>With the exception of the Nintendo DS version, which received mostly positive reviews, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> was met with a mixed critical response. Most of the criticism was aimed at the game's graphics, short length, and technical issues, as well as being too similar to its predecessors. The drastic differences between platforms was another point of criticism. The game was followed in October 2008 by <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Web_of_Shadows\">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></i>, which has no connections to the <i>Spider-Man</i> film series. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up\">beat 'em up</a> loosely connected to the films, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Friend_or_Foe\">Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</a></i>, was published by Activision in October 2007.  Following the expiration of Activision's licensing deal with Marvel, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> was delisted and removed from all digital store fronts on January 4, 2017.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<h3>PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows</h3>\n\n<p>Similarly to <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2004_video_game)\">Spider-Man 2</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> is a third-person action-adventure video game, set in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world\">open world</a> based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\">Manhattan</a>. Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Missions are structured in a non-linear manner like in the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a></i> series, meaning that the game features multiple storylines which can be played in any order the player desires. Once the player has completed a number of missions from each storyline, they unlock a main story mission, related to the plot of the film. In addition to the story missions, the game also features side missions, such as races, combat tours and disarming bombs, as well as random attacks in the streets by the city's gangs, which the player can choose to stop. If a number of gang attacks in a specific district are thwarted, then the gang loses control of that district and attacks will no longer occur there. This crime wave mechanic is also influenced by the story missions and combat tours involving each gang.</p>\n\n<p>Players can web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. The game introduces quick-time events and collectibles, which are scattered throughout the city, including the subway (which is now accessible while free roaming). It also features the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)\">symbiote</a> black suit, which is automatically unlocked after a number of story missions and introduces a \"rage\" mechanic, that is charged up by attacking enemies and allows the player to deal extra damage. In this version, the black suit can not be removed after unlocking it, and will be automatically and permanently removed after reaching a certain point in the story.</p>\n\n<p>The game also features an upgrade system where upgrades are unlocked automatically as the player progresses in the story. In the <i>Collectors Edition</i> of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> version, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)\">New Goblin</a> is a playable character, similarly to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)\">Green Goblin</a> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_film)\">first game</a>. The New Goblin is also briefly playable in the final mission of the game across all three platforms, and is available as downloadable content for both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network\">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live\">Xbox Live</a>. He can be selected from the game's menu, much like the player can select from regular Spider-Man and black suited Spider-Man once they completed the story with the former. If choosing to play as black suited Spider-Man, then the game starts from the beginning, but all upgrades are unlocked, therefore this essentially serves as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus\">New Game Plus</a>. If choosing to play as the New Goblin, then none of the story missions are available, but the player can still free roam through the game's map and complete side missions. On PC, the New Goblin is playable only through mods. Peter Parker in his civilian outfit is also playable on PC through mods, and through a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch\">glitch</a> that prevents progression in certain story missions across all three platforms.</p>\n\n<p>This version of the game plays similarly to its next-gen counterpart, except the combat system is mostly ground-based, like in <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>. The main narrative is mostly unchanged, except for several slightly altered missions, while most of the secondary storylines focusing on characters not featured in the film have been removed and replaced with new ones. The map has also suffered a few aesthetic changes due to these consoles' limitations. New <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery\">CGI</a> cutscenes are included, in addition to several recycled scenes from the next-gen version. The most notable change in the gameplay is the ability to change between Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume and the black suit at any time through a short quick time event (once the latter is unlocked). During the main storyline, the black suit requires to be removed regularly, because if worn for too long, the symbiote will corrupt Spider-Man, leading to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_over\">game over</a>. After removing it, there is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooldown\">cooldown</a> before the black suit can be worn again. After completing the main storyline, the black suit's rage meter will instead deplete to zero percent without killing Spider-Man, once it reaches its limit.</p>\n\n<p>The game features an upgrade system where upgrades need to be manually purchased; there are no upgrades for the black suit. Upgrades are purchased through hero points, similarly to <i>Spider-Man 2</i>, which are unlocked from completing either the main story missions or side missions, including races and combat tours, as well as some that appear randomly across the map. Unlike previous Spider-Man games, these random missions are activated through a radio transmission, allowing the player to accept or decline them, and may vary from stopping muggings to delivering fruit pies. The collectibles and crime wave mechanic from the next-gen version also return, albeit with several modifications. Collectibles, mainly the Spider Emblems, which can be found only during story missions, actually reward the player once found, by unlocking the black suit. The crime wave is now influenced mainly by the combat tours, as there are no longer main story missions involving the gangs. Rather than clearing the city of the gang's influence, the player's goal is to help the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department\">NYPD</a> take over, which is depicted as its own \"gang\", allied to the player, in the menu map.</p>\n\n<p>The primary features for the Wii version are motion controls. By flicking the Wii Remote &amp; Nunchuck, the player can perform various actions such as combat, and one of Spider-Man's trademark abilities, web swinging. There are also certain mini-games tailored to the motion controls. This can range from disarming a bomb, to completing quick time events. The PlayStation Portable version is a full-on port of the PlayStation 2 version with an extra feature exclusive to the version known as \"Conquest Mode\": an extra mode where the player has to traverse the city and complete challenges such as combat tours, delivering items, and protecting civilians under a time limit. The more challenges are completed, the more hero points the player earns. Once time has elapsed, the score is calculated and the most recent save is loaded; the mission can be replayed any time to get a higher score. Conquest Mode can be exited with a visit to the Daily Bugle building in order to return to the main game. Conquest Mode can be accessed via the title screen or Scrapbook.</p>\n\n<p>The Game Boy Advance version is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)\">level</a>-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics\">2D</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling\">side-scrolling</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up\">beat 'em up</a>; only the characters are rendered in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D\">2.5D</a>. A map is used to enter levels, and each level has question bubbles that give hints. The Nintendo DS version is completely 2.5D and uses the Touch Screen to execute most attacks. Players can put on the black suit at will, but it will be disabled if Spider-Man's health is too low. This version supports wireless multiplayer.</p>\n\n<h2>Synopsis</h2>\n\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n\n<p><i>Spider-Man 3</i> is set a year after the events of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2004_video_game)\">Spider-Man 2</a></i>. Since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Octavius_(film_character)\">Otto Octavius</a>' sacrifice, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City\">New York City</a> has seen no real major threat that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parker_(2002_film_series_character)\">Spider-Man</a> has not been able to handle, although recently four new gangs—the H-Bombers, the Apocalypse, the Waste Tribe, and the Dragon Tail—have begun dividing the city between them, engaging in a violent turf war. Peter Parker's personal life is also in turmoil, despite him finally getting to date his childhood crush, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson_(2002_film_series_character)\">Mary Jane Watson</a>, after she became aware of his double life. Peter's former best friend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)\">Harry Osborn</a>, who also learned his secret, despises him because he falsely believes that Spider-Man murdered his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)\">father</a>, while his job at the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Bugle\">Daily Bugle</a></i> is threatened by a new rival, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Brock\">Eddie Brock</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Special editions</h2>\n\n<p>Special editions of the game were available to PS2 and PS3 owners. The PlayStation 3 Collector's Edition artwork shows the fully colored Black Suit of Spider-Man instead of a hybrid of both suits. Common features for the PS2 and PS3 were an interview with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Arad\">Avi Arad</a>, chief creative officer of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Entertainment\">Marvel Entertainment</a> and founder of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios\">Marvel Studios</a>, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> movie webisodes, a behind the scenes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featurette\">featurette</a> with the cast, and a collectable lenticular card with the movie's images. The PS3 Collector's Edition came with a pre-installed DLC that featured the ability to play as the New Goblin (who becomes available only after defeating him in the game). The New Goblin DLC was later made available for download from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network\">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live\">Xbox Live</a> users on July 12, 2007.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p><i>Spider-Man 3</i> received \"generally positive\" reviews for the DS version but \"mixed or average\" reviews for all other platforms, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator\">review aggregator</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The PlayStation 2, Wii, and PlayStation Portable versions have been criticized for a short story mode and disappointing graphics, with <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar\">GamesRadar</a></i> suggesting that they were technically inferior to the preceding game from 2004. The Wii version has however been praised for the use of the Remote and Nunchuk in its gameplay, which is considered to be the Wii version's strongest point. The Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions, despite receiving only average reviews, have been universally better received than the PlayStation 2, Wii, and PlayStation Portable versions. The Wii version was given a \"D+\" grade by <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(magazine)\">The Wire</a></i>.<sup>[<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></i>]</sup> <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Play\">X-Play</a></i> gave the Wii version 1 out of 5 (the first Wii game to get 1 out of 5), the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions 3 out of 5, and the DS version 4 out of 5.</p>\n\n<p>The game was also criticized for not being the same version on each system. Some criticism has surfaced due to having New Goblin only fully playable in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was also criticized for having a lot of glitches. However, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer\">Game Informer</a></i> liked the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of game, giving them an eight out of ten.

    "description": "This prequel to Sniper Elite V2 is set three years before the events of the previous game, in Northern Africa during the World War II. The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne’s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind. A unique targeting system allows you to see where your bullet will hit the enemy’s body or a vehicle and the amount of damage it can deal. Fairburne can also use other types of guns, as well as explosives. Kills earn the player the points that push your character towards higher ranks. Besides the story mode, there’s a co-op mode and five multiplayer modes, including the classic deathmatch and “capture the flag”.",

A company specialised in the research, development and application of new technology and science, anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems! As part of our brand-new Save The Day program, you’ll be sent to one of many alien planets in an effort to contribute to Project Assembly, a project I am legally bound to not tell you anything about for fear of our lives. And my job.\nAs an engineer and pioneer, you won’t only be constructing and automating the very factory that will contribute to Project Assembly, but also explore and exploit the planet and its inhabitants as you expand. Don’t worry, we’re super inclusive when it comes to alien lifeforms! We’ll even allow for pets, how cool is that!?\nJust don’t tell R&D.\nBelow you can find the three main pillars of your mission! Time to get to work, and Stay Effective!\nThis motto is FICSIT Inc. property. Please do not use ironically.\nCONSTRUCT\nTo achieve company milestones according to satisfaction we expect you to construct your FICSIT Inc. factory in such a way that it allows for easy expansion and complexion. Not only will buildings grow more complex over time, so will the parts they produce. Project Assembly isn’t your average high-school science project. We’re making history here! Go big or go home! Of course, this requires both high-level and low-level power management, good luck getting to nuclear! We even support stuff like multi-floor warehouses so you can stack your buildings, and a whole bunch of navigational constructs like jump pads and walkways! Walkways are the best. They’re attached to the ground and everything.\nEmployee will be expected to fund their own travel expenses\nAUTOMATE\nSo you know how your FICSIT Inc. factory can be turned into this incredibly intricate maze of conveyor belts in every direction, merging, splitting, crossing each other above and below? Conveyor belts carry, after all, the life-blood of our company! Well, since you’ll be in a pretty big area you’re going to need outposts. To make your life easier, we’ve developed self-driving trucks and trains so you can set up your very own transport system between any point in your area!\nEXPLORE & EXPLOIT\nR&D hasn’t figured out how to clone materials yet, weirdly enough, so you’re going to have to go out and use our patented method of extraterrestrial pioneering! This means exploring to find more or new stuff to exploit, to help expand your FICSIT Inc. factory. You’re on an uncharted alien planet, so try to be careful, don’t go alone if you don’t have to, and use protection! Who knows what kind of organisms have made this place their home? Or who knows what awesome treasures you’ll find? Don’t worry, this is why we assigned you your very own FICSIT Inc. handler.",

It is the eleventh major installment in the series.\nIn the year 2054, the private military companies become the world's leading military power. Countries replace their own armies by hiring PMCs. You play as Jack Mitchell, the soldier of the biggest PMC named Atlas. You are a loyal combatant, yet a major conspiracy is unraveled in Atlas. \nThe game's core mechanics revolve around an exoskeleton that is worn by the Protagonist. Exoskeletons offer their users enhanced mobility, strength and unique abilities such as dash, ballistic shield or a short-timed boost. Advanced Warfare does not feature a tradition heads-up display, using holographic projection on the weapons as its interface. \nDuring singleplayer, the players are able to upgrade their exoskeleton using upgrade points that are gained after every mission. 22 points are required in order to purchase every exo upgrade. \nAs for the multiplayer, the game does not feature many changes apart from the enhanced mobility and the Pick 13 system that allows players to choose any equipment available as long as it does not exceed 13 allocated slots.",

    "description": "The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church.You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living.Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law?A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world.Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments.Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm.Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation.Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.Other recommended games from Kalypso Mediahttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1287840/Disciples_Liberation/",

    "description": "World of Tanks Blitz is a cross-platform action game, aiming at fierce tank combat. \nGameplay<h3/>\nThe game allows 7v7 battles. The teams are forming randomly, so there can be tanks from different classes (light, medium, heavy and destroyers) and countries (German, UK, USA, and others).\nThe player has to either destroy enemies’ units or capture the neutral base. The base is regarded as taken if your tank stays in a marked zone for a while without getting damaged. The capture proceeds faster as you place more tanks there. Also, there is a superiority mode, which requires the players to win, if they eliminate all foes’ vehicles and gain 1000 win points. Capturing points can earn these points and destroying enemy equipment. There is a possibility to form platoons for two people and to join clans. Many mechanics are taken from the PC-version, for instance, the physics of damage. While moving along the hilly terrain, you can also notice such mechanisms: you can do drift, driving a portable tank on a high-speed. Each map consists of two starting points of the teams. The battlefield itself has many objects and shelters: buildings, bridges, walls, trees.\nPremium features\nThere are two currency systems in the game: credits and gold. You can earn credits from the battles. Both group and individual victories are rewarded. Gold can be purchased for real money, and also received in the course of various actions. Some features of the game become available only if paid in gold.",

Under the daylight, zombies are weak and slow, but after the sunset, they become fast, strong and hungry for human flesh. You play as Kyle Crane, a special operative sent to the Harran city, which became a quarantined zone after the outbreak. In the expansion pack The Following, he learns about a cure for the plague, supposedly invented by a sect, and sets off to find out more about it. Crane will travel the countryside open world that is twice the size of the original game’s map. To fight off zombies, Crane will use not only a variety of weapons but also parkour movements, which are the definitive feature in Dying Light gameplay.\nThe Following introduces new weapons, several new game modes, such as bounty hunting which gives the player a new mission every day. The expansion allows the player to drive a buggy to run zombies over. There is a four-person multiplayer mode, and also the “Be the Zombie” mode, in which players can assume the role of a huge, powerful zombie.

The squad fight their way into the city, but an ambush kills all the team except Powell. Powell continues into a German base, where he rescues <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service\">S.A.S.</a> agent Major Jack Grillo and retrieves his equipment. The major and Lt. Powell split up, with Grillo securing transport, while Powell does sabotage in a motor pool. He links back up with Grillo, who has commandeered a jeep with a mounted machinegun. The two drive to a German airfield, where they successfully destroy the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190\">Fw 190</a> fighters and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87\">Stuka</a> dive bombers grounded there. While Grillo distracts the German forces, Powell sneaks into a bunker, cuts off Axis radio contact and fights his way to a coastal lighthouse to signal the Allied fleet to begin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Torch\">Operation Torch</a>, the invasion of North Africa. He escapes with Grillo in a German transport truck.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Allies' success in Africa, Powell and Grillo are sent to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Norway\">German-occupied Norway</a> to infiltrate the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim\">Trondheim</a>, where a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsmarine\">Kriegsmarine</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat\">U-boat</a> is being outfitted with a prototype <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxos_radar_detector\">Naxos radar detector</a>. Grillo makes it into the base first, but is killed in action by German guards while opening the front gate for Powell. Powell fights his way into the base, where he disguises himself as a German officer and infiltrates the loading dock. He goes to the lab where he destroys the Naxos prototype and gains access to a submarine intended to be fitted with the prototype and blows it up. He fights his way out of the base, where he is extracted by an Allied squad.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Powell's efforts, the German U-boat threat is neutralized, clearing the way for the Allied invasion of Europe, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord\">Operation Overlord</a>. Powell, as a part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Ranger_Battalion_(United_States)\">2nd Ranger Battalion</a>, is sent to Charlie sector of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach\">Omaha Beach</a> under Capt.

He is sent into the countryside beyond the beaches to assist the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division\">US airborne troops</a> in clearing a path for the forces advancing from Omaha beach towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carentan\">Carentan</a>. Along the way he calls air support on several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Flak_18/36/37/41\">Flak 88</a> cannons and destroys a battery of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebelwerfer\">Nebelwerfers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Powell is assigned to go behind enemy lines and acquire intelligence on German troop movements.

She sends him out to conduct various acts of sabotage against the German war effort. He raids a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_house\">manor house</a> being used as a command post where he secures important enemy documents, including the blueprints for the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_II\">King Tiger tank</a>. Powell escapes the manor house with Manon's aid.</p>\n\n<p>Powell's next mission involves hijacking a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_II\">King Tiger</a> tank and using it to secure a vital bridge at the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brest,_France\">Brest</a>. After navigating through the sniper-infested ruins, he meets up with the American tank crew chosen for the mission. Powell and the tank crew capture the King Tiger and use it to fight their way through the countryside. Upon reaching Brest, Powell provides cover for the King Tiger to protect the bridge, until reinforcements come to secure it.</p>\n\n<p>Powell's final mission sends him to Fort Schmerzen, a German <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_mustard\">mustard gas</a>-producing facility along the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Line\">Siegfried Line</a> that was previously raided by Lieutenant James Patterson (the main protagonist of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(1999_video_game)\">Medal of Honor</a></i> as well as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Frontline\">Medal of Honor: Frontline</a></i>), but has since been restored to operation, supposedly as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner-of-war_camp\">prisoner-of-war camp</a>, but is being used to produce mustard gas. Powell is parachuted into the woods, where he destroys some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_cm_Flak_30,_Flak_38_and_Flakvierling_38\">Flak</a> guns that are shooting Allied planes. Disguised as a German officer, he infiltrates a weapons depot, and destroys a stockpile of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StG_44\">StG 44</a> assault rifles. He destroys afterwards a German communications outpost in a nearby town, cutting off Fort Schmerzen's communications. Powell hijacks a freight train and along with a squad of US Rangers, uses it to reach Schmerzen. Upon arriving at Schmerzen, Powell and his fellow Rangers storm the fort and release all the prisoners. Powell fights his way into the lower levels of Schmerzen, where he discovers that the fort's mustard gas production facilities are still operational. He plants explosives on the gas facilities, and escapes just before Fort Schmerzen is destroyed.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>The game was developed by a team of 22 developers.

    "description": "Continuation of the sensational first-person shooter from Infinity Ward and Activision. It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year, but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage, the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. \r\n\r\nIf there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.\r\n\r\nAs in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.",

    "description": "Anno 1800 is the seventh installment of its franchise of real-time economic strategies. Like its predecessors, it is based around building cities.\n\n###Setting\nUnlike the previous two installments of the series, which were set in the future, Anno 1800 returns to the series' roots and is based on real history. The game is set in the 19th century and explores the first twenty years of Industrial Revolution era. The industrialization and rising capitalism greatly influence the gameplay. The game features units like trains and cannons and takes into account such factors as workers' strikes and environmental pollution.\n\n###Gameplay\nAnno series gameplay is a lot like if Civilization was in real time. In Anno 1800, the player controls an island country and administers its economy, military, diplomacy, and society. He or she discovers new technologies, explores the map, builds cities, factories, and farms, makes allies, and fights enemies. The game reintroduces randomly generated maps and physical trading goods that can be shipped by the routes. Unlike in the previous game, the combat is fully integrated into the gameplay and is not separated from the city building sessions. The game also features new elements such as tourism.\n\n###Modes\nThere are three main modes in Anno 1800: a sandbox mode, a campaign with a plot, and a multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</b></i> is a 2006 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter\">tactical shooter</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game\">video game</a> developed and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft\">Ubisoft</a>. It was released for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)\">Xbox</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>. As in previous <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon\">Ghost Recon</a></i> games, players command their team while neutralizing hostile forces and completing various mission objectives. These objectives can range from escorting friendly units across the map to rescuing hostages or taking out enemy artillery.</p>\n\n<p>The game places emphasis on using cover effectively in order to stay alive, together with sound strategic co-ordination to successfully complete mission objectives. A new feature is the <i>Integrated Warfighter System</i>, a system based upon the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Force_Warrior\">Future Force Warrior</a> program.</p>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_Advanced_Warfighter_2\">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2</a></i>, the game's direct sequel, was released a year later in 2007. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a> version was released for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One\">Xbox One</a> backwards compatibility in 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>Gameplay emphasis in <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</i> is placed upon the player doing the bulk of the fighting in each mission, while relying on tactical combat rather than arcade run-and-gun shooting to overcome enemies. Combat in the game is more forgiving than in previous titles in the series, with players being able to survive several bullet hits before dying, instead of dying after only a few shots like in the original <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</i>. However, players are unable to regain lost health in the middle of a mission, and a single headshot or a sustained burst of fire can still kill the player instantly.</p>\n\n<p><i>GRAW</i> features numerous firearms, many based on real weapons, including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_&amp;_Koch_G36\">Heckler &amp; Koch G36</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_M9\">Beretta M9</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_SCAR\">FN SCAR</a>, in addition to prototypes such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MR-C\">MR-C</a>. The game also makes use of various other pieces of equipment, including tanks, helicopters, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_personnel_carriers\">armored personnel carriers</a>, and remote-controlled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicles\">unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, which can be used tactically to overcome obstacles, and scout out the environment, in order to complete objectives. <i>GRAW</i> features three versions of the game that each have slight minor variations in storyline/missions depending on the version; the main storyline, though, remains the same between the versions. While both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions are essentially the same title, the Xbox 360 and Windows versions each stand out on their own with their own unique features, including the ability to command a squad of soldiers indirectly.</p>\n\n<h3>Cross-Com System</h3>\n\n<p>One unique feature of the gameplay is the cross-com system, which is designed to allow indirect control over friendly units, assisting them on a mission (e.g. helicopters, UAV drones, etc.), by giving them commands on what to do, whether to locate enemies or deal with a particular threat encountered. This system can be used in conjunction with the game's Intel map - a tactical map showing the entire play area and location of objectives, enemies and friendlies/allies - to issue commands. Notably, this gameplay feature varies between the different versions. For the Xbox 360 version, the system highlights enemies spotted by both the player and both their squad and other allies, while the Microsoft Windows version only highlights enemies seen by the player's squad and not themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox console versions of <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</i> are played in first-person, but have notably fewer features than those found in the Xbox 360 or the Windows versions. The most notable differences to the other versions is that players only have a single AI-controlled teammate following them on missions (as opposed to a squad of 3 soldiers), there are more levels but of shorter lengths, and that player character Scott Mitchell never speaks throughout these versions.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike all other versions of <i>GRAW</i>, the Xbox 360 version gives players a choice between using either a third-person or first-person perspective during the campaign mode, and also features a unique covering system that allows the player to duck behind objects for protection from gun-fire while performing tactical maneuvers. In addition, some levels feature on-rail sections in which players must eliminate as many enemies as possible from their airborne transport via the use of a mounted gun, and if a mission provides them with a squad, orders given via the cross-com system apply to the entire squad, and not to individual squad members. Players cannot recover ammo from fallen enemies but can take their weapons if needed; otherwise they must re-arm at either rally points or ammo stations.</p>\n\n<p>The Microsoft Windows version of <i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter</i> is played from a first-person perspective. This version features larger levels than those of the console versions with enemy AI more likely to use ambush tactics, thus greater emphasis is placed upon using squad tactics and having more situational awareness in each mission. The cross-com system in this version is more flexible, capable of issuing more controlled commands to individual squad members, as well as plotting out attack routes and battle plans for other friendly units. In addition, players cannot pick up discarded weapons, unlike the other versions, but can take ammunition from the weapons of dead enemies or allies, if the player's weapon is of the same caliber.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike other versions, players may select the loadouts for their selected team before the start of a mission, although this is done with no briefing given, with each member able to carry a primary weapon and a secondary weapon, while either carrying extra ammunition or a heat-seeking anti-tank weapon. Unlike other versions, every Ghost member has a maximum weight limit on how much they can carry, with them becoming fatigued from sprinting at a much faster rate the more equipment they are carrying. Weapons are able to be modified with various attachments, such as optical sights, grenade launchers, silencers, and vertical foregrips, and each modification has used on a weapon has its advantages and disadvantages.

Elsewhere in the city, a Ghost team led by Captain Scott Mitchell is deployed to recover Guardrail IX, an American communications disruptor device stolen from a spy plane that was shot down in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua\">Nicaragua</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'état\">coup d'état</a> suddenly occurs and the NAJSA conference is attacked by militants who kill the Canadian Prime Minister, prompting Ghost commander General Joshua Keating to reroute Mitchell's team to extract Ballantine and Ruiz-Peña. The Ghosts rescue them and defeat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-air\">anti-air</a> emplacements at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_International_Airport\">Mexico City International Airport</a>, while Ruiz-Peña survives an assassination attempt at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._embassy\">U.S. embassy</a> after the Ghosts intervene. News reports reveal the coup is being spearheaded by the Aguila 7, a rogue special forces unit led by General Ontiveros and his son Colonel Carlos Ontiveros. Stuck in Mexico City, Ballantine and Ruiz-Peña agree to authorize a U.S. military intervention to support the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Armed_Forces\">Mexican Armed Forces</a> and restore order.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell's Ghost team is ordered by Major General Martin to clear a route to Mexico City, where they defeat artillery and anti-air batteries, assault <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapultepec_Castle\">Chapultepec Castle</a>, and secure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1A2_Abrams\">M1A2 Abrams</a> tanks for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Army\">Mexican Army</a>. Aguila 7 kidnaps Ballantine and hides him in the slums, but while the Ghosts rescue him, they find the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_football\">nuclear football</a> is missing, and discover Aguila 7 is using Guardrail IX to disrupt U.S. military communications. Mitchell's team locates and destroys most of Guardrail IX before supporting a joint advance into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zócalo\">Zocalo Plaza</a> and rescue Major General Martin from a helicopter crash. Keating and Ballantine learn the nuclear football and remnants of Guardrail IX are being used by Aguila 7 to hack <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command\">NORAD</a> and gain control over American <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICBM\">ICBMs</a>, causing Russia and China to ready their own and buying time to gain international support for the coup.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell's team spearheads the final assault on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Palace_(Mexico)\">Palacio Nacional</a>, destroying the last elements of Guardrail IX and capturing General Ontiveros, but Carlos flees with the nuclear football in a stolen Ghost <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk\">Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk</a>. Mitchell's team pursues Carlos to the U.S. embassy, where they defeat Aguila 7, kill Carlos, and recover the nuclear football.

    "description": "Assassin’s Creed Rogue is an action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Sofia. It is the seventh game in the series, continues the story of Black Flag and serves as a prequel to Assassin's Creed 4. Its final mission is also a set up for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\n###Plot\n The game's story takes place both in the past and the modern times. During the Seven Years' War, a young American assassin Shay Patrick Cormac trains with his old French friend. After an unsuccessful mission, Shay is disappointed by the Assassins Brotherhood and goes rogue.\n\nMeanwhile, in the present, a virus attacks Abstergo Entertainment servers. A major conspiracy is revealed by the player after fixing the servers.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players can explore the northern part of North America - a frozen seashore of the Atlantic, the territory of the Apache, the Valley of Rivers, and New York, that got remade with respect to the real city of the eighteenth century. \n\nThe game features the same ship sailing mechanics as features in Assassin's Creed IV. It is essential for Shay to escape the Assassins he will encounter, minimize the casualties of his sailors, and destroy enemy ships. Shay's ship named \"Morrigan\" is well-adapted for sailing through the ice and the seas of the Atlantic. It is equipped with barrels of oil and Puckle guns.\n\nIn his inventory, Shay has several swords, an air gun, a pistol, and several grenades. The game rewards creative mission approaches and does not restrict the players in any manner.",

Los jugadores pueden ver el estado de la galaxia hasta una hora en el futuro para preparar sus estrategias.<br><br><strong>3 Razas Únicas:</strong> Es el Año de Guerra 35 y las emergentes TEC, los alienígenas Vasari y los desviados Advent han tenido que adaptarse y evolucionar para sobrevivir.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>TEC:</strong> Los habitantes de esta región de la galaxia, los TEC, son humanos que se han unido bajo la Coalición de Emergencia de Comerciantes para combatir el imperio alienígena Vasari. Dependen en gran medida del comercio para sostener su base industrial y aumentar los ingresos de recursos.<br></li><li> <strong>Vasari:</strong> Hace diez mil años, el Imperio Vasari dominaba sobre cientos de planetas y docenas de especies conscientes. Ahora, huyendo de un enemigo desconocido, utilizan su dominio del espacio de fase para conquistar y adquirir recursos que les permitan continuar su éxodo.<br></li><li> <strong>Advent:</strong> Una civilización de humanos que fueron expulsados por los Comerciantes hace más de mil años, los desviados Advent han regresado con psiónicos tecnológicamente amplificados y el poder de la Unidad, una devastadora expresión de su voluntad colectiva.</li></ul><br>Cada raza presenta condiciones iniciales únicas, mecánicas de juego, unidades, habilidades, objetos y tecnologías. Sus revolucionarios nuevos Sistemas Imperiales añaden un nivel completamente nuevo de capacidades estratégicas:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Comercio TEC:</strong> El nuevo sistema de comercio TEC les permite adaptar dinámicamente su economía ajustando la asignación de recursos comerciados según la demanda.<br></li><li> <strong>Resonancia de Fase Vasari:</strong> Estructuras estratégicamente ubicadas recolectan Resonancia de Fase permitiendo a los Vasari personalizar los efectos de su dominio global de fase.<br></li><li> <strong>Unidad Advent:</strong> Permite a los Advent aprovechar la voluntad colectiva de su población, desbloqueando el potencial completo de las habilidades globales de la Unidad.</li></ul><br><strong>6 Facciones Jugables:</strong> Las razas principales se diferencian aún más por subfacciones únicas, cada una con características y estilos de juego propios que reflejan sus motivaciones y objetivos. Por ejemplo, el TEC: Primacy es un imperio xenófobo 'humanos primero' centrado en la agresión y el Vasari: Exodus está dispuesto a destruir planetas para alimentar su imperio móvil.<br><br><strong>Simulación de Combate:</strong> Una simulación de combate detallada añade una increíble profundidad al juego táctico. Las torretas con sus propias velocidades de orientación y seguimiento hacen que las soluciones de disparo sean importantes en las batallas. Los misiles completamente simulados pueden ser bloqueados por los barcos o destruidos por la defensa puntual. Nuevas mecánicas en torno a escudos, armaduras y puntos de casco otorgan mayor profundidad a las unidades y decisiones tácticas.<br><br><strong>Gestión del Imperio:</strong> Ahora puedes analizar, personalizar y mejorar todos los planetas y naves fácilmente en un solo lugar, sin la tediosa tarea de buscar y hacer clic en todas las unidades de tu imperio. El sistema de Construcción Inteligente organizará toda la cadena de requisitos previos para completar cualquier solicitud de construcción de objetos, investigación o unidades.<br><br><strong>Gestión de Flota:</strong> El nuevo sistema de flotas incluye la capacidad de solicitar refuerzos específicos al instante. Las unidades solicitadas se ponen en cola automáticamente desde la fábrica óptima y se reúnen con la flota. Combinado con la Construcción Inteligente, esto te permite concentrarte en las decisiones tácticas importantes y en la estrategia general.<br><br><strong>Personalización de Unidades:</strong> Las superficies planetarias ahora pueden personalizarse con objetos especiales que varían según la raza y el tipo de planeta. Las naves capitales, titanes y bases estelares también pueden personalizarse con objetos específicos de cada raza para complementar las carencias en la composición de la flota o enfocarse en estrategias particulares.<br><br><strong>Facciones Menores:</strong> Numerosas facciones menores ahora habitan la galaxia ofreciendo comercio, subastas de objetos raros y, con suficiente influencia, acceso a sus habilidades más poderosas. ¿Te aliarás con ellas o las aniquilarás para evitar que tus enemigos se vuelvan contra ti?<br><br><strong>Diplomacia:</strong> Las nuevas características incluyen un sistema de oferta / contraoferta renovado, la capacidad de ceder o exigir planetas, y los revolucionarios alto el fuego con tiempo limitado que impiden que tu 'aliado' te traicione hasta que expiren, ¡pero no pierdas de vista el reloj!<br><br><strong>Motor de Juego Multinúcleo de 64 bits:</strong> El motor de Sins II aprovecha todos los núcleos y la RAM disponibles para maximizar el rendimiento, ahora y en el futuro. Iluminación dinámica, renderizado basado en físicas, texturas de alta resolución y más crean un tapiz impresionante.<br><br><strong>Soporte multijugador para 10 jugadores:</strong> Un sistema en línea basado en la nube que admite tanto 'códigos de unión' como salas de espera para facilitar más que nunca jugar con otros. Ahora es posible reincorporarse a las partidas en curso si un jugador se desconecta o tiene que irse; los humanos incluso pueden tomar el control de los jugadores IA si un amigo se une tarde.<br><br><strong>Soporte de Mods en el Juego:</strong> El soporte de mods ha sido integrado en el juego, facilitando el descubrimiento, la instalación y el compartir mods. Los mapas personalizados se comparten automáticamente en los juegos multijugador, evitando la molestia de tener que descargarlos todos antes de jugar.<br><br><strong>Fácil de aprender; difícil de dominar:</strong> Con una interfaz de usuario elegante e intuitiva, Sins II es fácil de empezar a jugar. Sin embargo, dominar tu facción elegida requerirá verdadera habilidad.",

The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player's liking. \nThere is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner.

Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time. Guys, on the other hand, are more into races, so they do the dirty job in the trio.",

    "description": "The game belongs to the Borderlands game line, its action takes place between the events of Borderlands and Borderlands 2.\nEverything happens on the moon of Pandora - Elpis. The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.",

Resident Evil Revelations keeps the story and mechanics from the previous installments.  It’s set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, taking place right after the creation of BSAA. Agents Jill Valentine and Parker are sent to the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in order to find two missing field agents Chris Redfield and Jessica. But they find a trap, set by a bioterrorist organization Veltro. And now players will have to solve puzzles and to kill monsters. \nRevelations are using an episodic storytelling format, separating single player campaign into different segments, allowing players to experience different scenarios and play as several characters throughout the game. But it keeps the main focus and the events on the ghost ship. But aside from the single-player campaign, players can try to complete modified story mode scenarios, fitted for the combat survival. Completing the Raid Mode objectives will allow one or two players to receive experience points and weapons.",

Thomas Conlin, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps\">U.S. Marine</a> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War\">Pacific Theater</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II\">World War II</a>, taking part in the landing on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarawa\">Tarawa</a> atoll.\nAs Conlin's Amtrac approaches the shore, it's hit by an artillery shell, throwing Conlin and the other passengers into the shallow ocean, forcing them to wade ashore. Conlin fights his way onto the shore, only to get cut down by a bullet during a Japanese counterattack. As he bleeds out, the game flashes back to the start of Conlin's first day of basic training, where the player is introduced to the characters that will become his squad; the squad leader Frank Minoso; a big, smooth talking, New Jersey native; sniper William \"Willie\" Gaines, a country boy from North Carolina; and corpsman James Sullivan, a quiet sailor from a rich family in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Park,_Illinois\">Oak Park</a>, Illinois. After training, Conlin is assigned, without the rest of his training battalion, to serve aboard the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_(BB-39)\">USS <i>Arizona</i></a>.

During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarawa\">invasion of Tarawa</a>, Conlin secures the beachhead before neutralizing a major Japanese command center and destroying Japanese AA guns, which are used by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Armed_Forces\">Japanese</a> to prevent American landing craft from approaching Tarawa atoll. Conlin and his men then continue to clear Tarawa of the remaining enemy forces.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p><i>Pacific Assault</i> was developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Los_Angeles\">EA Los Angeles</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Games\">EA Games</a> for the PC.

    "description": "PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS is battle-royale shooter made only for the multiplayer experience. Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay.",

    "description": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is an action-adventure third-person game developed by Ubisoft Montreal. It is the direct sequel to Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones.\n\n###Plot\nThe Prince decides to visit the kingdom of his elder brother Malik to train in martial arts. Upon the Prince's arrival, the kingdom is found to be under a siege. Trying to repel the invaders, Malik uses an ancient mystic medallion that frees the ancient army of Solomon. Upon breaking free, the army turns the people of the kingdom into sand statues. Only the Prince of Persia can stop the army from destroying the kingdom.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game uses the usual Action-adventure formula where the player-controlled character traverses the level while avoiding traps, solves puzzles, and fights enemies using aerobatics and special powers. The game features a complex fighting system. \n\nAs the game progresses, the Prince learns more and more skills. The player is able to control all four nature elements: fire, earth, water, and air.

    "description": "Dead or alive\nA game of insane complexity in the best traditions of the Dark Souls series, the games of which set the standard of quality in the genre. The game was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja for the Sony PlayStation 4 console and PC in 2017. The development team previously released projects such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. The version of the game for the PC contains all the additional content that came out on the console.\nThe setting\nThe game takes place in the seventeenth century Japan, in the fictionalized version of the Sengoku period, when the country was engulfed in the flames of civil war. The player takes control of the An Anglo-Irish sailor named William, who sets out in pursuit of the villain in the country of the rising sun and finds himself entangled in the mystical and political upheavals that pervaded all of Japan. Despite the fantasy elements, the plot uses real prototypes of historical events and personalities.\nKey features\nThe controls are quite simple: two types of attack, block and dodge are available. The gameplay is modified by role-playing elements: for example, at the start of the game, it is necessary to choose which weapon in William will be predefined. This helps to determine which skills to develop, with further completion. Like Dark Souls, enemies are reborn after each interaction with the local analog of bonfires - Shrines.",

    "description": "Bioshock 2 is a shooter with RPG elements, centered around resource-management to a great extent: more like an RPG than a shooter. The game is made by 2K studios and represents the final part of a dystopia dilogy — preceded by the original Bioshock. Its successor is Bioshock Infinite.\nYou play as Big Daddy — a giant mech with a drill replacing one of the hands. The game, while they both are telling the story of a charming Rapture — the city descended from Orwell's and Zamyatin's pages where the society's greatest mind have suffered a severe decline.\nThe central feature of the game is the unique abandoned city's aesthetics — minding the time Bioshock 2 is still a beautiful title, with detailed drawn water and strange surroundings, never mind the variety of foes.\nThe remaster introduces a 4k resolution — it is now more enjoyable to explore Rapture and enjoy its various landscapes and sea-filled quarters. Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials,  which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.",

    "description": "Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.\nMost of the game's story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.\nThe game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. \nThe Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.",

    "description": "This post-apocalyptic game that spawned the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise is inspired by (but not really based on) the 'Roadside Picnic' novel by brothers Strugatsky and Tarkovsky's movie 'Stalker', borrowing some of the terms and aesthetics from both. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is set in Ukraine, in the infamous Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Several parts of the open-world setting were modeled after the real Chernobyl surroundings, including the power plant and the city of Pripyat, although designers took some liberties. The bleak environment and dark ambient music help to create an unsettling atmosphere of this place. \nAccording to the backstory, in 2006, the second Chernobyl disaster occurred, turning the surrounding area into post-apocalyptic ruins, full of grotesque mutants and time-space anomalies. The \"stalkers\" in this world are the explorers who wander The Zone in search of valuable loot. You play as the Marked One, a stalker who lost his memory. All that remains of his past is a memo that says “Kill Strelok”. The Marked One will have to learn more about himself, Strelok, The Zone, and its mysteries. The plot is non-linear, and there are multiple endings that depend on the quests you completed earlier.",

    "description": "DMC: Devil May Cry is a hack-and-slash adventure game, the fifth installment in Capcom’s Devil May Cry franchise and reboot of the series. This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  \nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features.",

It was released in 2009 on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p><i>Damnation</i> features large, open environments where a variety of acrobatics and Hollywood-action stunts are possible. <i>Damnation</i> features verticality which differentiates it from many other games in the genre. <i>Damnation</i> has steam-powered vehicles which are also able to execute various feats of mobility, such as climbing up walls.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n\n<p><i>Damnation</i> is set in an alternate history version of the U.S., in which the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\">American Civil War</a> stretches several decades and highly advanced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk\">steampunk</a> technology spearheads the great technological advancement, instead of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine\">combustion engines</a>. This results in the introduction of highly advanced technology like steam-powered vehicles, war machines and robots. During the war, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison\">Thomas Edison</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla\">Nikola Tesla</a> were charged with sedition, which enables a genius inventor named Prescott and his corporation, P.S.I., to become exclusive suppliers of arms to the US government. Prescott's advanced weaponry enables the Civil War to come to an end but Prescott has been scheming to overthrow the U.S. government and remake the U.S. into an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism\">American Empire</a> to rule the world.</p>\n\n<p>Several years after the end of the bloody American Civil War, industrialist Prescott overthrows President <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s administration and establishes a dictatorship. Several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army\">US Army</a> splinter groups, primarily led by Captain Hamilton Rourke, form a resistance movement against Prescott.</p>\n\n<p>During Rourke's adventures, he works with or against a number of characters, including Yakecan, an ally and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States\">Indian</a> healer, Jack, a scientist for the enemy, and Professor Winslow, Jack's father.  He also works with a shaman named Akahando against the forces of Prescott.</p>\n\n<p>The Resistance army is fighting PSI, led by Commander Selina, on a bridge in a deserted city named Arrowtree.  Hamilton and his group fight their way through the city to the bridge and destroy it. PSI then uses a specialized tank to bridge the gap with special tracks and continue fighting.  As they make their escape the Professor is captured and the rest retreat on to their airship, the Corsair.  Then Yakecan's brother Akhahandro tells them that Prescott is raping the earth of its resources to make \"Serum\", which makes his soldiers fight harder.  The group leaves to rescue the Professor with the help of their new powers that allow them to see enemies before they see them. The group lands in Boom Town where the citizens are crazy on serum.  They were miners before Prescott infected their water supply and made them blood thirsty.  They fight their way through and meet up with the injured enemy Jack, who happens to be the daughter of the Professor, they take her and he repairs her arm.  But she escapes on a plane and the group goes after her but are shot down by Selina's troops.  Prescott captures Akahando and forces him to use his powers to see the future.  Hamilton fights his way through the rest of the city and finds Selina who attempts to kill them with a turret but Jack comes and helps them fight.  They defeat Selina and escape and Jack finds out Prescott's true intentions on domination.  Selina survived and rides away with Hamilton going after so he can find his missing love Daydon.  He and Jack make it to an ancient ruined site and find Selina and the hooded stranger who turns to be a transformed and tortured Daydon who begs Hamilton to end her life.  They fight and Daydon is defeated but Selina escapes.   The PSI army attacks Terra Verte.  Hamilton makes it to the city where he and his group battles to liberate the city.  They battle Selina again which ends with Jack drowning her in a fountain.  They activate the city water defense system which opens the water gates and drowns the invading forces in sea water.  The group infiltrates Prescott's HQ and the final battle begins.  Prescott reveals his powerful weapon, a mech, and fights Hamilton.  Hamilton destroys the mech but Prescott lifts the machine up and throws it away after taking a large dose of his own serum. He then tries to kill Hamilton.  Hamilton defeats Prescott and his corpse turns to ash. The group saves Akahando and leave in their Airship finally ending Prescott's reign of terror and bringing peace to America.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>The game originally started as an <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_2004\">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></i> mod, and was entered into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games\">Epic Games</a>' first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Something_Unreal_(contest)\">Make Something Unreal</a> contest. It came in second place for best Total Conversion game modification. The retail version retains much of its mod's gameplay, including third-person gameplay, acrobatic moves and spirit vision.</p>\n\n<p>A demo was scheduled to be released on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network\">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live_Marketplace\">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> in early January 2009 but that was never released.</p>\n\n<p>The game was delayed numerous times from its original fall 2008 release window, with numerous release dates thereafter being given and then missed before finally being released in May–June 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The game's cover uses Ray Larabie's freeware font \"Anklepants\", which borrows heavily from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Broadcasting\">Group W</a> typeface introduced in 1963, for their logos and on-air imaging (though the game was released in 2009, 11 years after Group W went defunct, and before it was merged into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS\">CBS</a>, which itself was later merged the original incarnation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_(1952–2005)\">Viacom</a> when CBS and Viacom merged).</p>\n\n<h2>Promotion</h2>\n\n<p>A console design contest was made available for US residents. Contestants could submit their designs using any available design tool. The prize was a limited edition PlayStation 3 with a steampunk design.<sup>[<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></i>]</sup></p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p><i>Damnation</i> received \"unfavorable\" reviews on all platforms according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator\">review aggregation</a> website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> reviewer Greg Miller said that the graphics, voice acting, and gunplay are terrible: \"Avoid this game at all costs\". Andy Hartup wrote in <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_World\">Xbox World</a></i> that the game was \"[o]ne of the worst shooters of this generation. The clue really is in the name...\"</p>\n\n<p>Junglist and Bajo, from the Australian gaming show <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Game_(TV_program)\">Good Game</a></i>, said that they enjoyed the environment and exploring but felt the A.I. was overpowered and unintelligent.</p>\n\n",

    "description": "The third part in the Dead Space series. Like the previous installments, Dead Space 3 is a science fiction horror game in the vein of Alien film series.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the year 2514. The humanity has discovered alien artifacts, the Markers. They can be the source of powerful energy but also provoke outbreaks of Necromorphs, the undead monsters. The radical Unitologists movement wants to spread the Necromorph infestation.\n\nThe main protagonist of the series, Isaac Clarke, resides at the Moon after he destroyed Markers in Dead Space 1 and 2. His ex-wife Ellie Langford went missing with her expedition on the frozen world of Tau Volantis. John Carver, the secondary protagonist of Dead Space 3, asks Isaac to travel with his team to Tau Volantis. This world may be the key to the secret of Markers.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player assumes the role of Isaac Clarke on his quest. The game introduces the ability for Isaac to roll over and take cover to avoid being hit. Monsters and weapons from the previous games make a return, and there are new enemies like Nexus or Unitologist soldiers. The game also introduces the Weapon Bench system that allows to craft new weapons and upgrade them.\n\n###Multiplayer\nDead Space 3 was the first in its series to include an online cooperative multiplayer. In this mode, the second player assumes the role of Sergeant Carver and can accompany Isaac in the story campaign. Co-op mode unlocks additional missions that are unavailable in the single-player mode.",

    "description": "Thirteenth in a row the main game of the series Call of Duty\nThe single player campaign of this game takes action far beyond our planet. Earthlings do not have enough resources, they go after them to other planets, organize colonies, but at some point the inhabitants of the colony on Mars begin to fight for independence from Earth.\nNew conditions and mechanics\nNew conditions bring new gameplay mechanics into the game, such as zero-gravity environments. Players have a boost pack, and a grappling hook, which allow players to move in these zero-gravity environments easily, they can visit different planets, satellites and asteroids in the solar system.\nBoth space combat and the \"boot-on-the-ground\" gameplay are available in the game as its key focuses.\nThe player controls Captain Nick Reyes, a Tier 1 Special Operations pilot, engaged in aerial combat with enemies using his transforming fighter, the Jackal.\nRetribution is a central hub of the game’s world. In Retribution, you can view your progression and start main campaign missions. There are also group of secondary quests called \"Ship Assaults\" which gives cosmetic and customization items, upgrades to the Jackal, and some new story details.\nHero also has a wrist computer, which allows him to hack into enemies' gadgets and machines.\nMultiplayer\nThe «Combat Rigs» is a major overhaul to the class system introduced in Infinite Warfare. Like a Specialist system in Black Ops III, there are six rigs: Warfighter, Merc, FTL, Stryker, Phantom and Synaptic. With different payloads, weapons, abilities and playstyles for each class.\nZombies\nThe game has a completely separate part - the cooperative multiplayer Zombies mode, which has its own gameplay mechanics and story.\nIn this mode, the action takes place not in space, but on Earth. Or rather, in the special reality of the horror film, in which the characters of the game and the actors are captured - the stars of many famous films: David Hasselhoff, Kevin Smith, Pam Grier, and Cassandra Peterson who reprises her role as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.",

    "description": "Final Fantasy IV (ファイナルファンタジーIV, Fainaru Fantajī Fō), known as Final Fantasy II for its initial North American release (and not to be confused with the original Japanese Final Fantasy II), is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the Final Fantasy series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. Final Fantasy IV introduced innovations that became staples of the Final Fantasy series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own unchangeable character class.\nFinal Fantasy IV has been ported to several other platforms with varying differences. An enhanced remake, also called Final Fantasy IV, with 3D graphics was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 and 2008. The game was re-titled Final Fantasy II during its initial release outside Japan as the original Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III had not been released outside Japan at the time. All later localizations, which began to appear after Final Fantasy VII (released worldwide under that title), used the original title.\nWith its character-driven plot, use of new technologies, and critically acclaimed score by Nobuo Uematsu, Final Fantasy IV is regarded as a landmark of the series and of the role-playing genre. The various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. A sequel, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the Wii Shop Channel on June 1, 2009. In 2011, both Final Fantasy IV and The After Years were released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection, which also included a new game, set between the two; Final Fantasy IV: Interlude. Ports of the Nintendo DS remake were released for iOS in 2012, for Android in 2013 and for Windows in 2014.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Medal of Honor: Airborne</b></i> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> video game developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Los_Angeles\">EA Los Angeles</a> and released worldwide on mobile phones in August 2007, on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a> in September 2007, and on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> in November 2007. It is the 11th installment of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(video_game_series)\"><i>Medal of Honor</i> series</a>, and uses a modified version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_3\">Unreal Engine 3</a>. In the game's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game\">single-player mode</a>, players assume the role of an American <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper\">paratrooper</a> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)\">US 82nd Airborne Division</a> who is airdropped with his squadrons and fights against hostile forces across six large missions that take place during the latter half of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_World_War_II\">European theater of World War II</a>, while in its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game\">online</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game\">multiplayer</a> mode, players can choose to fight as Allied soldiers that parachute into the battlefield, or as Axis soldiers who defend on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike previous games in the series that employed a linear style of gameplay in its single-player mode, in which the start point and direction is already laid out, <i>Airborne</i> employs a more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay\">nonlinear gameplay</a> style in both modes, in that players can start their game anywhere in the map that they land in and complete the majority of a mission's objectives in any order.</p>\n\n<p>The game has received more favorable reviews for the PC and PlayStation 3 versions than its Xbox 360 version. While the game was planned to have versions made for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii\">Wii</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)\">Xbox</a>, these were later cancelled, with the first two consoles having <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Vanguard\">Medal of Honor: Vanguard</a></i> as an exclusive title between them instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>In both modes of gameplay, players have access to three different categories of weapons that they can use in battles, either selected before or acquired during a game - Main Weapons, covering rifles, sub-machine guns, auto/assault rifles, shotguns and anti-tank weapons; Side-arms, which have infinite ammo and are mainly used as a back-up when out of ammo for main weapons; and grenades. Traditional game mechanics for the game such as crouching and \"cooking\" grenades, are complemented with the ability to lean out of cover to take shots at enemies, while players may also engage opponents in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_combat\">close combat</a>. Like many games in the <i>Medal of Honor</i> series, players have a health bar, divided into four units, that begins to deplete when taking damage; if the player avoids taking any damage, the current unit of health being depleted will regenerate in time, but any units lost will require the player to find first aid kits. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_gaming)\">HUD</a> allows the player to keep track of what weapon they are using, the amount of ammo they have in it and on hand to reload it with, how many grenades they have, and a compass that keeps track of where allies and enemies are, along with markers indicating which direction a player is being damaged from and where active grenades have landed.</p>\n\n<p>What makes <i>Airborne</i> unique in the series is the ability for players to choose where they land as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper\">paratrooper</a> on the battlefield in both modes. Once a player begins descending onto the map they are fighting on, they can direct where they will begin from, controlling the speed of the descent, thus giving greater flexibility and strategy on how they deal with enemies, with the added ability of being able to kick enemies they land upon.</p>\n\n<h3>Single-player</h3>\n\n<p>In the game's main campaign, players assume the role of a fictional paratrooper working alongside other members of an American airborne division, to complete a series of objectives within each of the campaign's six missions. The player is given a briefing on each mission's initial objectives, as well as a map of where they will be operating, including the location of heavy enemy concentrations (marked red) and safe landing sites (marked green). In this mode of gameplay, players can equip two main weapons, designated as primary and secondary weapons, and chose what loadout they have before beginning a mission from a selection of Allied and Axis weapons; additional weapons can be unlocked by either taking those dropped by enemy soldiers during a mission or reaching later missions where they become available in. During missions, weapons earn <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point\">experience</a> from killing enemies, with the amount per kill greatly increased from performing headshots, melee and multiple kills. Once a weapon earns enough experience, it receives an upgrade that improves how effective it is for the player, with upgrades ranging from increased damage, a higher rate of fire, and reduced weapon recoil. Each weapon can be upgraded three times, and has its own set of upgrades; once it is fully upgraded, the weapon's icon on the interface changes to reflects its fully upgraded appearance.</p>\n\n<p>When descending by parachute into a mission's battlefield, the type of landing the player makes affects the speed at which they can begin to fight - \"Greased\" landings, by moving forward before touching down, allow the player to be ready instantly to fight; \"Flared\" landings allow the player to land safely, but require a little time to be combat-ready; \"Botched\" landings, by coming in too hard, cause the player to be more vulnerable to attack as they recover and become combat-ready. The player can also perform a \"Skill\" drop, by landing safely and in a specific way, at a site designated by a white parachute (i.e. landing through an open doorway); each mission has a set number that the player can find on when on the ground, and which they can attempt at any time when their character is descending down onto a mission's battlefield. Once in a mission, players do not face enemies with randomized appearances and weapons, but rather a predetermined selection of enemy types; while the player faces the weakest kind to begin with, more difficult and challenging opponents are introduced as the game progresses.</p>\n\n<p>Each mission the player undertakes consists of two phases. In the first phase, gameplay is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay\">non-linear</a>; in addition to choosing where they wish to land, players can decide the order in which objectives are completed, though they are restricted to landing and moving within the area of the map that is accessible to them. If the player is killed during this phase of a mission, they re-spawn in the air, descending down to the battlefield once more, and can thus take advantage of this to put themselves in a more favourable position to complete an objective. Upon completing the objectives outlined in a mission's briefing, the game's second phase begins and focuses on a more scripted and linear path, with objectives unlocked in sequence and a new area of the map becoming accessible. In this phase, the player no longer can parachute back down to the mission's map, instead re-spawning to the last checkpoint they reached.</p>\n\n<p>In the game's multiplayer mode, players work as a team, playing as either Allied or Axis soldiers, over six maps - while the game uses three from the single-player mode, along with another that is scaled down in size, the other two maps are original design. In a match, players begin by choosing what main weapon they begin with - rifle, SMG, auto-rifle, sniper and anti-tank - which is denoted by what role they are in (i.e. for SMG, Allies get the Thompson, while Axis get the MP40), and can scavenge a second main weapon during the match. If a player is killed, they can change what weapon they use before they respawn, though lose the second weapon they scavenged. Matches can be set to one of three modes - Airborne Objective (a variation on the \"seize-the-objective\" multiplayer mode), Airborne Team Deathmatch, and Team Deatchmatch - with the airborne-based modes utilising <i>Airborne</i>'s unique paratrooper aspects of gameplay, in which Allied players can land wherever they want on the map being used, including when they respawn, but are vulnerable during their descent as Axis players can shoot them down.</p>\n\n<p>Players can acquire access to weapon upgrades, similar to those in single-player, depending on what type of match they undertake - unranked matches grant access to upgrades and allow match's server settings to be optimized per what the player(s) want; ranked matches focus on persistent character development that grant gradual access to upgrades over time.</p>\n\n<p>The game's online servers along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(2010_video_game)\"><i>Medal of Honor</i> (2010)</a> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Warfighter\">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a></i> were shut down on February 22, 2023.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>In 1943, following training in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa\">North Africa</a>, Private Boyd Travers learns that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division\">82nd Airborne Division</a> is to help with the invasion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy\">Italy</a>, beginning with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Husky\">Operation Husky</a>. After nearly being killed by friendly fire from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy\">US Navy</a>, Travers and his platoon land in the village of Adanti, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily\">Sicily</a>, where the group assists in neutralising several anti-aircraft nests while combating Italian soldiers, before venturing deeper into the village to find a missing sniper team and aiding his squadron in repelling a German counterattack. Travelling to the Italian mainland, the 82nd take part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Avalanche\">Operation Avalanche</a>, eliminating a munitions stockpile, fuel depot, motorpool, and radio equipment at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paestum\">Paestum</a> archaeological dig near <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples\">Naples</a>, with Travers assisting in an assault on a ruined temple housing anti-air guns, destroying them before Allied <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_P-40_Warhawk\">P-40</a> fighter bombers arrive and destroy the German artillery located around the dig site.</p>\n\n<p>One year later, on June 6, 1944, the 82nd take part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Neptune\">Operation Neptune</a>, lending assistance to the American forces preparing to land on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach\">Utah Beach</a> as part of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord\">Operation Overlord</a>. Working with his squadron, Travers manages to eliminate all potential threats to the invasion force, including a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I\">Tiger tank</a> and a series of bunkers, before heading to the shoreline and eliminating German pillboxes that endanger the incoming landing forces. A few months later, Travers and his squadron take part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden\">Operation Market Garden</a>, assisting in the capture of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nijmegen\">Nijmegen</a> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands\">Netherlands</a>, while preventing the Germans from destroying the town's bridge with explosives planted on it. Despite a fierce counterattack, including the use of Panzerschreck rocket launchers and Tiger tanks, the 82nd manage to secure the bridge for American <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_Sherman\">Sherman</a> tanks to cross, while Travers receives a promotion to Corporal for his actions.</p>\n\n<p>After Market Garden ends in failure for the Allies, Travers transfers to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Airborne_Division_(United_States)\">17th Airborne Division</a>. In March 1945, his division takes part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Varsity\">Operation Varsity</a>, landing within an industrial complex in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essen\">Essen</a>, Germany, to destroy its stockpile of munitions and tanks, while shutting down its weapon production facilities. Despite a counter-attack by heavily armored <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allgemeine_SS\">Allgemeine SS</a> troopers wielding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_42\">MG42s</a> that inflict heavy losses on the Allied troops, Travers manages to overcome the new threat and successfully destroys an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_train\">armoured ammunition train</a> that arrives at the complex. A few days later, with Operation Varsity proceeding as planned, Travers finds his squadron going deeper into enemy-held territory within Essen, with the task of destroying a massive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak_tower\">flak tower</a> that Allied bombers had failed to level. Despite heavy opposition, Travers helps to neutralize key fortifications within the tower, before assisting an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_engineer\">engineering unit</a> and detonating charges placed beneath the tower, destroying the structure as the war in Europe begins to enter its final stages.</p>\n\n<p>In a closing report, Travers' CO comments on how history will remember the sacrifice and courage of the men in the Airborne divisions for what they did during World War II.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>Development of <i>Airborne</i> started in late 2004 when the game designers wanted a new game that would \"really revolutionize the <i>Medal of Honor</i> scene\". The idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper\">paratrooper</a>-based gameplay came up and as such a free-roaming environment was needed, which became the key focus of the game. Each mission starts with a jump and the developers wanted to make the experience as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay\">nonlinear</a> as possible, with no starting points and as such the scenario unfolding in a different way each time, as opposed to previous World War II FPS games where there is a set starting and end point.</p>\n\n<p>The lead designer was Rex Dickson, and the executive producer was Patrick Gilmore, who previously worked on <i>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.</i> The development team even had an actual historical advisor, who is an enthusiast on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces\">Airborne forces</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_weapons\">weapons</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II\">World War II</a>, attempting to ensure historical accuracy and authenticity. Each sound was recorded from hundreds of real World War II-era artifacts including real weapons, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank\">tanks</a>, and one of the last remaining airworthy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-47_Skytrain\">C-47s</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, the game was going to include pathfinder missions done by soldier Eddie LaPointe that would include more stealth. They would come before Travers' drop. This was later cut as EA wanted to simplify the action and focus on large scale fights with Travers instead. EA signed partnership with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep\">Jeep</a> to feature drivable vehicles in the game. This was taken out of the final version as well, because levels were made with cramped spaces and short roads and alleys, so there was no room left to drive.</p>\n\n<p><i>Airborne</i> was developed in close consultation with the <i>Medal of Honor</i> community, via forums and summits. Certain community leaders who run <i>Airborne</i> fan-sites were invited to a multiplayer preview summit in July 2007, and many problems were identified that would hamper the game's popularity within the <i>MOH</i> community, the most important ones being lack of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_server\">dedicated server</a> and issues with mouse lag and low <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate\">frame rate</a>. As a result of the summit, the most critical issues were able to be fixed in time for the game's release, and the other issues in time for the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)\">patch</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A single-player <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo\">demo</a> was released on August 23, 2007, featuring the first half of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Husky\">Operation Husky</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Game engine</h3>\n\n<p><i>Airborne</i> uses a heavily modified version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_3\">Unreal Engine 3</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine\">engine</a>. The game's core development was started with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Games\">EA</a>'s acquired <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renderware\">Renderware</a> engine, but it made the switch to the Unreal 3 engine in early 2006 which delayed the game by over a year. The engine was specifically designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX\">DirectX 9 and 10</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer\">PCs</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>, and supports many rendering techniques utilized within the graphics capabilities of <i>Airborne</i>, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_rendering\">HDRR</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-pixel_lighting\">per-pixel lighting</a> and dynamic shadows.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay\">non-linear</a> gameplay style of <i>Airborne</i>, the developers had to build an entirely new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> system to deal with the many ways the player can interact with or approach the computer-controlled allied and enemy soldiers (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">NPCs</a>), and for them to react to the situation accordingly. With \"Affordance A.I.\", the characters have an awareness of enemy approach patterns, and also features of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain\">terrain</a> and urban infrastructure that provide a tactical advantage, such as cover, high ground and open doorways. This allows AI characters to take intelligent combat actions based on their surroundings, as opposed to the scripted movements of previous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\">linear</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">FPS</a> games.</p>\n\n<p><i>Airborne</i> uses two systems to guide the physical and emotional reactions of the AI characters to what is happening around them. \"E-cap\" (emotion capture) is used to create more human-like emotions on the characters' faces by blending an awareness of their surroundings and other NPCs, for example an AI soldier that started to move forward would jump back for cover if an ally next to him was shot.</p>\n\n<h2>Audio</h2>\n\n<p><i><b>Medal of Honor: Airborne Original Soundtrack</b></i> was released on July 31, 2007. It features the in-game tracks and musical scores of the game, all of which were composed by the award-winning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Giacchino\">Michael Giacchino</a>, who also composed scores for some of the previous Medal of Honor games, including the main theme for the whole series.</p>\n\n<p>The first scoring session was held at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood on April 20, 2006, to score the teaser trailer that would premiere at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo\">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) in the summer of 2006. A 75-piece orchestra, conducted by Marshall Bowen, performed the music. Eight months later, Giacchino was wrangling a few projects, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)\">Lost</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)\">Ratatouille</a>, and it was decided that instead of trying to blast through the writing process and compose all of the music for 2-days of recording, it would be best to focus on one day of recording, and then record the rest of the music in the spring when the game's development had progressed sufficiently.</p>\n\n<p>On December 11, 2006, Giacchino recorded the first round of cues for the game with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Studio_Symphony\">Hollywood Studio Symphony</a> at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros\">Warner Bros</a>. Four months after that, on March 28, 2007, the final round of music was recorded.</p>\n\n<p>The <i>Airborne</i> soundtrack has been said to be based on the Medal of Honor themes of the past, but \"brings a dark uncertainty that communicates the ominous journey of the first US Airborne combat troops\".</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the new soundtrack the game also re-uses scores from five of the series' previous games, these being  <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(1999_video_game)\">Medal of Honor</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Underground\">Medal of Honor: Underground</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault\">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Frontline\">Medal of Honor: Frontline</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Pacific_Assault\">Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault</a></i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p>The PC and PlayStation 3 versions received \"favorable\" reviews, while the Xbox 360 version received \"average\" reviews, according to video game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator\">review aggregator</a> website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a> was pretty average on the game, saying, \"The single-player campaign doesn't get cooking until the last two levels, but those two levels combined with solid multiplayer make it worth enlisting in <i>Airborne</i>.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a> fared a bit better on the game in its review, saying that, \"<i>Airborne</i>, while not perfect, is definitely the best game in the franchise to come along in quite a while.\" Press Start Online stated that <i>Airborne</i> was \"a <i>Medal of Honor</i> game that's not only good, it demonstrates a level of imagination and innovation that's becoming increasingly rare in the genre.\" Most reviewers praised the music from the games of <i>Medal of Honor</i>, with IGN stating in particular that the title music was said to bring back some classic memories from <i>Allied Assault</i> and the starting music for Operation Market Garden for Campaign.</p>\n\n",

But it was more than relics. Something awakened, an unspeakable horror from an ancient past, and the citizens of Gladius found themselves trapped in a terrible war for survival.\nGladius Prime was once a planet of peace. Now there is only war.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyvxGl_hKf0\nWarhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War brings you to a world of terror and violence.

    "description": "UBOAT\nUBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.\n\n\nIn UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish.Survival\nThe extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others.\n\n\nWhile your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships.\n\n\n Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer.\n\n Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen.\n\n If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts.Kriegsmarine careerDuring the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems.\n\n\nBrave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances.\n\n\n Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds.\n\n Receive additional permissions for the reputation points.\n\n Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more.\n\n Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies.Accurate simulationGame's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.\n\n\nEven small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.\n\n\nPerfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!\n\n",

    "description": "State of Decay 2 is an open-world zombie-themed survival game with RPG elements, the second installment in State of Decay series.  \n\n###Gameplay \nIn State of Decay 2, you take a role of zombie-apocalypse survivor. After the tutorial, you can choose one of three maps to explore.\nThe goal of the game is to clear the maps from Plague Hearts – sources of Blood Plague disease that makes zombies more aggressive and dangerous. The world is entirely free to explore. Throughout it, you come across survivor’s bases that you can upgrade with different facilities such as kitchens, gardens, workshops and many more. During the game you are also going to meet new survivors, that would join you and become playable. Each survivor has its progression system with numerous stats to upgrade and abilities to unlock. The death in the game is permanent for every survivor. The game offers many unique items and weapons, both ranged and melee, to fight zombies and hostile survivors. The ammunition for firearms is limited therefore frequently it’s better for players to avoid combat and use stealth and distraction items rather than brute force. One of the game’s most notable features is the full-fledged cooperative multiplayer support that allows groups of up to four players to go through the entire game.",

It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year, but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage, the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. \r\n\r\nIf there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.\r\n\r\nAs in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.",

    "description": "Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too.\nCreate your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories.\nBuild the infrastructure and manage its traffic, including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections.\nPlan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops.\nSend your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods.\nSell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings.\nEnjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles, as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's.\nPlay the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live.\nEconomic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play –one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources.\nIncreasing difficulty.As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work.RESOURCES & INDUSTRY\nThere are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them.\nEvery commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses.WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDS\nEvery worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time – cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc.\nEvery worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements.TRANSPORTATION\nYou have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance.\nIt is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time.ECONOMY SIMULATION\nThe game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction.\nYou purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.\nAs time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.",

The city is in the throes of an outbreak, with the shuffling undead wandering the streets and the urban jungle becoming a tangle of overturned cars and crumbling buildings. Picturesque, isn’t it? It’s against this backdrop that Jill Valentine prepares to make her escape, though there’s a bit of a twist in the timeline for those of you who aren’t familiar with the original. If you played Resident Evil 2 earlier this year, you may know that Leon and Claire arrived in the city on September 29th. Jill’s story, however, starts a few days earlier. As an accomplished member of S.T.A.R.S. and a survivor of the incident in the Arklay Mountains (the site of the original Resident Evil), Jill has some experience with the horrors that await.",

    "description": "Promising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.\r\nKey ingredients\r\nEngaging turn-based combat - Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling a powerful attack or spell. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\r\nUnshackled traversal -  Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.\r\nPrequel story set in The Messenger’s universe - Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you’d expect from a Sabotage production.\r\nFull-on dynamic lighting - Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\r\nThe Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre - Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and timesinks.",

The surrounding objects are created with maximum realism, the degree of damage depends on the calibre of the bullets used by the players or on the total power of the laid explosives. Walls can be destroyed, creating new firing positions and shelters. Optimal use of the potential of destruction often becomes a guarantee of victory. Defenders can limit the ability of attackers to destroy, using kits to strengthen the walls and the device of some operatives.\nThe primary game mode - multiplayer, normal or rating. During the game in the last mode, the player is assigned a certain rank, and parameters such as the ratio of kills/deaths and wins/losses are recorded in his profile displayed in the game.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Hitman: Contracts</b></i> is a 2004 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game\">stealth video game</a> developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IO_Interactive\">IO Interactive</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidos_Interactive\">Eidos Interactive</a> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)\">Xbox</a>. It is the third installment in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_(franchise)\"><i>Hitman</i> video game series</a>, and serves as both a remake of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47\">Hitman: Codename 47</a></i> (2000) and sequel to <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_2:_Silent_Assassin\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a></i> (2002), incorporating gameplay elements introduced in the latter into missions from the first game, which have been remastered with enhanced graphics. The game also includes several new missions, which serve as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)\">flashbacks</a> experienced by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cloning\">cloned</a> assassin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_47\">Agent 47</a> after almost being killed on a failed mission.</p>\n\n<p><i>Hitman: Contracts</i> was met with generally positive reviews; praise was directed at the improved gameplay elements, graphics, soundtrack, darker tone and atmosphere, while criticism was reserved for the lack of significant improvements and the familiarity with the previous two games. As of April 2009, the game has sold around 2 million copies. High-definition ports of <i>Contracts</i>, <i>Silent Assassin</i>, and the sequel <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_Money\">Blood Money</a></i> were released on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a> in January 2013 as the <i>Hitman HD Trilogy</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>In <i>Hitman: Contracts</i>, players control protagonist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_47\">Agent 47</a> from a third-person perspective, who is sent to various locations across the globe to assassinate specific targets. A wide array of weapons can be used, from kitchen knives, assault rifles and handguns to belt-fed machine guns. While stealth and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception\">subterfuge</a> is encouraged, the game allows the player to take a more violent approach and gunfight their way to their mission goals. As players progress through the game, they can collect the various armaments found in the levels, allowing them to be used in future missions. Aside from the more straightforward ways of killing targets such as gunplay and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling\">strangulation</a>, several missions allow the player more subtle ways to eliminate hits, such as judicious use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison\">poison</a>, or arranging \"accidents\" like a heat-induced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction\">heart attack</a> inside a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna\">sauna</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Players are rated on their performance based on several factors; key among which are the number of shots fired, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">non-player characters</a> (NPCs) killed (and whether they were armed adversaries or innocents), and the number of times the guards are alerted. The lowest rank is \"Mass Murderer\", which is awarded to players who kill large numbers of NPCs in the pursuit of their target and do not use stealth. The highest rank is \"Silent Assassin\", which is earned when the player accomplishes their mission without being detected, and generally without killing anyone other than the intended target(s).</p>\n\n<p><i>Contracts</i> continues the trend of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_user_interface\">context sensitive</a> actions, which means that one button is used in multiple situations for multiple uses. For example, when the player is near a door, the context sensitive button will allow the player to perform door-relevant actions such as keyhole-peeking, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking\">lock picking</a>, or if allowed, simply opening it. When the player is near an unconscious or dead NPC, the same button will allow the ability to either acquire the person's outfit, or drag the body to an area where it will not be found by various types of guards.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the context sensitive button, the \"Suspicion Meter\" returns as well; this meter informs players of how close they are to blowing their respective cover. Actions like excess running indoors, brandishing weapons openly, residing in restricted areas, or sneaking can raise suspicion. Proximity will also usually raise the meter. If the \"Suspicion Meter\" fills, guards will open fire on sight of the player and the current cover becomes useless. If the guards discover a fallen body, or if an unconscious person wakes and alerts them, the \"Suspicion Meter\" will raise much faster than it would otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disguise\">Disguises</a> can be either found in the environment or taken from the bodies of male NPCs. Depending on the disguise, the player can then access areas restricted to most individuals in a level. These disguises can be seen through by guards, as stated above; e.g. if guards in a level are all wielding shotguns, a player dressed as a guard but not similarly equipped will draw more suspicion. Also, certain behaviors (like picking locks) will cause guards to see through a disguise as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>On 17 March 2004, around two years after the events of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_2:_Silent_Assassin\">Silent Assassin</a></i>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_47\">Agent 47</a> is shot and critically wounded while carrying out a mission in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris\">Paris</a>, France, for his employers, the International Contracts Agency (ICA). Returning to his hotel room, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47\">he reflects on his past</a>, beginning with his escape from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detașamentul_Special_de_Protecție_și_Intervenție\">Romanian special forces</a> after killing his creator, Dr. Otto Ort-Meyer, at his own facility. 47 then recalls various contracts he carried out over the years, including the assassination of two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fetishism\">sexual fetishists</a> who had kidnapped and murdered a client's daughter in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest\">Bucharest</a>, Romania; the killing of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market\">black marketeer</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_Krai\">Kamchatka</a>, Russia, selling weapons to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism\">terrorists</a>, and the destruction of their weapon labs aboard a submarine; the murder of a corrupt <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility\">nobleman</a> and his son in England; the assassination of a biker crime lord in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam\">Rotterdam</a>, Netherlands; and the killings of three of his five genetic \"fathers\", namely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_trafficking\">arms trafficker</a> Arkadij Jegorov, who the bikers were doing business with in Rotterdam, terrorist Frantz Fuchs – incidentally, the brother of the black marketeer in Kamchatka – in a hotel in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest\">Budapest</a>, Hungary, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(organized_crime)\">Triad</a> boss Lee Hong in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong\">Hong Kong</a>, China.</p>\n\n<p>During this time, an ICA doctor arrives and performs emergency surgery on 47 before he can bleed out, but officers from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGN\">GIGN</a> storm the hotel to capture 47. While the ICA doctor is forced to flee without dressing the wound, 47 regains his strength and prepares to deal with the officers, before recalling the briefing for his current contract. He remembers that he had taken out two of the three targets he had been sent to eliminate (an event later addressed in <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_Money\">Hitman: Blood Money</a></i>), all of whom were involved in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution\">child prostitution</a> ring in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe\">Eastern Europe</a>. He also recalls that the third target, corrupt GIGN officer Albert Fournier, survived 47's attempt on his life after being tipped off to his presence, and was responsible for his injury.</p>\n\n<p>As the GIGN prepares to storm his room, which is slowly being filled with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas\">tear gas</a>, 47 escapes from the hotel, intending to complete his contract. Upon reaching the streets, he finds and kills Fournier, before escaping to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport\">Charles de Gaulle Airport</a>. Boarding a plane that is leaving the country, 47 is reunited with his handler Diana Burnwood, who confirms his suspicion that someone knew about the contract and warns him that the ICA is being targeted by the same group. 47 agrees to handle the matter and takes possession of a file which names the group as the Franchise, an enemy of the ICA that seeks to undermine them and gain control of governments worldwide.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>The third <i>Hitman</i> game was originally meant to be the final game of a trilogy, but due to time pressure from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IO_Interactive\">IO Interactive's</a> then publisher, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidos_Interactive\">Eidos</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IO_Interactive\">IOI</a> split into two teams to work on <i>Hitman: Contracts</i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_Money\">Hitman: Blood Money</a></i> at the same time, with <i>Hitman: Contracts</i> being a smaller game containing remastered levels from <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47\">Hitman: Codename 47</a></i> (2000) in addition to new levels. <i>Hitman: Contracts</i> was developed on a tight schedule to release two years after <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_2:_Silent_Assassin\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a></i>. The game was released in 2004 in North America on 20 April, in the UK on 30 April, in Australia on 13 May, and in Japan on 14 October.</p>\n\n<h2>Soundtrack</h2>\n\n<p><i>Hitman: Contracts Original Soundtrack</i> was composed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesper_Kyd\">Jesper Kyd</a> and released in 2004. The score features the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_music\">Latin</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir\">choral</a> arrangements as in all the other scores; however, they are heavily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)\">sampled</a> and mixed into the dark <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music\">electronic</a> soundscape. As summed up by Kyd, \"First of all it is a much darker score. <i>Hitman 2</i> was an epic story that kind of spanned all over the world. This one, although there are different locations, it's not one big epic story. It's a lot of darker, psychological small stories mixed together, so the score follows the darker aspect of Hitman and his career.\" The score was awarded the title of \"Best Original Music\" at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Games_Awards#2004\">2005 BAFTA Games Awards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the original Jesper Kyd score, the game features the following songs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_Your_Head_on_My_Shoulder_(song)\">Put Your Head on My Shoulder</a>\" by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anka\">Paul Anka</a> in Level 2 \"The Meat King's Party\". 2:37</li>\n  <li>\"A Different Kind of Love\" by Dick Walter in Level 4 \"Beldingford Manor\" 5:18</li>\n  <li>\"Immortal\" by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(band)\">Clutch</a> in Level 5 \"Rendezvous in Rotterdam\".</li>\n  <li>\"Walking Dead\" by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puressence\">Puressence</a> in Level 6 \"Deadly Cargo\".</li>\n  <li>\"Le Souteneur (Monsieur Claude)\" by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_Larage\">Faf Larage</a> in Level 12 \"Hunter and Hunted\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<p><i>Hitman: Contracts</i> received mostly positive reviews. Critics praised the improved gameplay elements, graphics, soundtrack, darker tone and atmosphere, while criticism was directed towards the familiarity and the lack of significant changes and additions from the previous game.</p>\n\n<p>Although <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a></i>'s Greg Kasavin liked that some of the missions from <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47\">Hitman: Codename 47</a></i> are featured here with graphical enhancements, he did feel it was a \"cheap move.\" Kasavin also criticised the normal difficulty in the game; he felt it was too easy and that players can take the 'Mass Murderer' route with little to no consequences. Air Hendrix of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamePro\">GamePro</a></i> said of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions, \"In this captivating outing, 47 revisits the past while modernizing the nagging flaws of his previous games, making for his best trail of assassinations yet.\"</p>\n\n",

    "description": "The third game in the series, Bioshock takes the story of the underwater confinement within the lost city of Rapture and takes it in the sky-city of Columbia. Players will follow Booker DeWitt, a private eye with a military past; as he will attempt to wipe his debts with the only skill he’s good at – finding people. Aside from obvious story and style differences, this time Bioshock protagonist has a personality, character, and voice, no longer the protagonist is a silent man, trying to survive.\r\nOpen and bright level design of Columbia shows industrial colonial America in a seemingly endless carnival. But Bioshock is not famous for its visuals, but for its story.  Mystery and creative vision of Irrational Games invite players to uncover the secrets of Columbia’s leader - Zachary Comstock and save Elizabeth, the girl, that’s been locked up in the flying city since her birth.\r\nUnique weapons and mechanics of Vigor will make encounters different, helping players to adjust to the new found mobility and hook shot, making fights fast-paced and imaginative.",

    "description": "The Evil Within 2 is survival horror game with an accent to the cinematic gameplay and crafting mechanics. This is the second title in the series by Tango Gameworks.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is experienced in the third person, \"behind-the-shoulder\" view. One of the title's main attractions is the auteur game design by Shinji Mikami who inspired both games of the series.\nHis style mixes absurdist plots, dark, horror movie-like environments, and almost absent jumpscares. The player must explore the vast maps in search of clues, collectibles, and story-related events. The game is highly non-linear and allows completing mandatory missions whenever one likes it. The time between the quests may be spent on crafting materials out of available resources, completing side quests and develop Sebastian Castellanos' — the protagonist's — abilities. There is a total of five skill trees each corresponding to playstyle and physical characteristics.\n\n###Plot\nThe game follows a story of a haunted mental hospital which was the set",

    "description": "Total War: ROME REMASTERED lets you relive the legacy that defined the award-winning strategy game series. Remastered to 4K with multiple improvements to visuals as well as refinements to gameplay, it’s time to revisit a true classic. Not everyone gets a second chance to conquer the Roman Empire.\nROME REMASTERED includes the Alexander and Barbarian Invasion DLCs, as well as a copy of the original ROME: Total War Collection*, if you don’t already own it.  \nImproved Visuals\nROME REMASTERED brings the classic Rome visuals up to date, with 4K optimization, ultra-widescreen and native UHD resolution support. This visual upgrade extends across a multitude of features, including re-modeled buildings and objects, and environment effects like dust clouds and heat haze. The refreshed campaign maps also boasts new high-resolution models, and units have been remodelled and retextured to look their very best on the battlefield. \nModern Features\nROME REMASTERED includes a host of modern features and improvements to existing mechanics. The in-game camera has been enhanced, including map rotation and wider zoom level in Campaign mode. Heat maps and new icon overlays have been added for gameplay mechanics such as diplomacy and security. In Battle, the new tactical map, unit displays and range markers give you greater command over Rome’s battlefields.\nEnhanced Game Mechanics\nPlayers can now expand their armies and experience 16 additional factions that were previously locked, giving a grand total of 38 playable factions. In a first for Total War, you can now take your favourite faction to battle against friends in cross-platform multiplayer between Windows, macOS and Linux. A whole new agent type has also been added to the fray; Merchants can be sent all over the world to create trade links, access resources and buy out rivals to increase your income and assert your faction’s economic power.\nHalf-Price Offer\nTo celebrate the return of Rome, we have an offer for those loyal fans that already own the original game on Steam. If you already own ROME: Total War, you can purchase ROME REMASTERED for half-price until May 31st, 16:00 PDT.\n*Please note, ROME: Total War Collection is only playable on Windows and will not be available to play until the release of ROME REMASTERED.",

The action begins in 2065, 40 years after the events of the second part, so the game has several historical references. However, the game is not a direct sequel to the previous Black Ops game. Players are offered to assume the role of a CIA special unit trooper trying to get along with the new artificial intelligence DNI (Direct Neural Interface) system and to solve mysteries hidden in it. The whole gameplay is divided into three usual for Black Ops series game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. The single-player campaign can be also completed in a squad (up to four members). Players are able to choose proper equipment and even customize the character before starting another mission. After the completion, each level could be replayed in a “realistic” difficulty or in a “Nightmares” mode (regular enemies are replaced with zombies).",

This was done in order to put emphasis on a player's skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.\nThere is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.\nPlayers can download the game for free, yet they will have access to only one Champion, Ranger.

It is the earliest game in the Assassin's Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin's Creed Origins.\nPlot\nThe events of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There's also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin's Creed Origins.\nGameplay\nUnlike most earlier installments of Assassin's Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.",

After sustaining heavy injuries in the battle with Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse, BJ Blaskowicz orders a nuclear strike on Deathshead's compound in order to cripple the Nazi war machine, but he is evacuated by his comrades before the rocket launch. Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.\nThe New Colossus features several stealth-action elements, just like the previous title in the series. There are some major differences in the mechanics: now BJ can modify his weaponry on-the-go, dual wield two different weapons at the same time. The cover system makes a comeback. The Protagonist doesn't stick to cover, leaning out of it instead.\nThe game offers a linear storyline, but the player is free to complete side-missions in any order they like. Completing these missions is rewarded with new weapon upgrades.",

    "description": "Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China is the part of the Chronicles series. It is the first installment out of three in total with the other games being dedicated to India and Russia.\nGameplay\nThe game is the two-dimensional platformer with the agile camera which can be tilted. Such titles are also called 2,5D platformers. The protagonist encounters waves of enemies, and the player chooses between the various weaponry to deal with them. There are also parkour elements: one climbs ledges, jumps onto wooden beams and uses ropes to travel around the levels.\nSubstantial attention is paid to the stealth mechanics. The protagonist can crawl behind the obstacles and take enemies down from a distance.  The Chronicles are in the way reminiscent to the original Prince of Persia series.\nThe game is composed of twelve episodes and takes place in China provinces like Na'an and Macau. \nPlot\nThe game is the straight sequel of Assassin's Creed: Embers — the short film about Shao Jun — the disciple of Ezio Auditore who is the protagonist of the three previous Assassin's Creed chapters.  The setting is the XVI century China during the Ming Dynasty rule. After the training under the guidance of Ezio ended, Shao returned to China to fight the local Templar clan called  Eight Tigers.",

Now there’s only the giant open world to explore. Fallout 4 introduces the mechanics of settlement building, where players can build their own little town. Gathering material for crafting and building brings more “survival” elements into the old formula.

    "description": " \nDoom (1993) - Original Version\nThe demons came and the marines died...except one. You are the last defense against Hell. Prepare for the most intense battle you’ve ever faced. Experience the complete, original version of the game released in 1993, now with all official content and Episode IV: Thy Flesh Consumed.\n \nDoom II – Original Version\nHell has invaded Earth, and to save it, you must battle mightier demons with even more powerful weapons. This beloved sequel to the groundbreaking DOOM (1993) introduced players to the brutal Super Shotgun, the infamous Icon of Sin boss, and more intense FPS action.\n \nTNT: Evilution  \nThe UAC relocated their experiments to one of the moons of Jupiter. A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel, was granted access. But when it got close to the base, demons poured out. All your comrades were slaughtered or zombified. This time it's not about survival. It's about revenge.  \n \nThe Plutonia Experiment\nEvery effort has been made by the nation's top scientists to close the seven interdimensional Gates of Hell, but one portal remains open. Alone, you must infiltrate the ravaged base, defeat the demon Gatekeeper, and seal the last Hell portal before the undead take over the world.  \n \nMaster Levels  for DOOM II\nThis expansion includes twenty additional levels, all with the same hell-spawned horrors and action of the base game. Each level was created by independent designers and supervised by id Software.\n \nSigil\nCreated by id Software co-founder, John Romero, and released as an episode-sized mod consisting of 18 new maps, Sigil fits in between the timelines of DOOM (1993) and DOOM II.  Baphomet, the gatekeeper of Hell, “glitched the final teleporter with his hidden sigil, whose eldritch power brings you to even darker shores of Hell. You fight through this stygian pocket of evil to confront the ultimate harbingers of Satan, then finally return to become Earth’s savior.”\n \nLegacy of Rust\nCreated in collaboration by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames, Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons.  This 16-map Episode is broken up into two 8 map sections:  The Vulcan Abyss and Counterfeit Eden.",

Thanks to the multi-channel audio sampling of real GT cars, the game conveys captivating and immersive acoustic surroundings and realistic environmental effects.\nCARE FOR DETAILS\nEven the secondary details are faithfully reproduced to make you feel the thrill of being in the cockpit of a real racing car. Doors, windshield wipers, headlights, racing lights, racing equipment and control devices such as ABS, traction control, engine ignition and ECU mapping, are all under the driver’s management to assure the best performance and offer the player total control of the car.\nTHE MOST ACCURATE CIRCUITS\nThanks to Laserscan technology, every official circuit is recreated with the utmost accuracy: all curbs and details perfectly fit their real counterparts to grant a gaming experience as faithful to reality as possible.\nADVANCED MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY\nA well-structured ranking system will evaluate individual performance and driving behaviour to reward the most virtuous drivers and promote fair play in online competitions.

The Special Events will allow you to gain a first-hand experience of the most noteworthy real-life Blancpain GT Series challenges.\nHIGH-LEVEL HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY\nAssetto Corsa Competizione ensures full compatibility with a wide range of peripherals from gamepads to professional steering wheels.\nMOTION CAPTURE FOR REALISTIC ANIMATIONS\nMotion capture technology is used to create the animations of mechanics and drivers in an even more realistic fashion, and guarantee a high level of player engagement during races, pit stops and driver changes.\nBLANCPAIN GT SERIES\nEncouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing.\nWith both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season – comprising five sprint events and five endurance events – crowns the world’s most complete GT drivers.\nA Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world’s leading 24-hour races.",

For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played wit",

    "description": "Conviértete en el héroe de tu propia película de acción, intriga y terror. Una misteriosa fuerza paramilitar se infiltra en un complejo aeroespacial multimillonario capturando prisioneros pero sin exigir nada. El gobierno responde con el envío de un equipo de Fuerzas Especiales que termina siendo masacrado. La retransmisión en vivo de la masacre muestra una inexplicable oleada de destrucción que hace pedazos a los soldados. Sin nada a lo que recurrir, se crea el equipo de élite F.E.A.R. (Fuerza de Élite de Asalto y Reconocimiento) para enfrentarse a estas extraordinarias circunstancias. Se les ha encomendado una sola misión: Evaluar la amenaza y eliminar a los intrusos a cualquier precio.<br><strong>F.E.A.R. Extraction Point</strong> Extraction Point arranca donde acabó el juego original – con una explosión. El helicóptero que transporta al equipo F.E.A.R. intenta alejarse de los alrededores, pero termina estrellándose. Por tanto el equipo F.E.A.R. se ve forzado a buscar un punto de extracción alternativo, luchando todo el rato con Alma, que ahora es libre, y con sus secuaces a lo largo de la ciudad devastada.<br><strong>F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate</strong> Mientras que el equipo F.E.A.R. y los Delta Force luchan para controlar la situación, se envía un segundo equipo F.E.A.R. para tratar de arrojar alguna luz sobre el oscuro pasado de la Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC). Como miembro del equipo F.E.A.R. secundario, tu misión consiste en recabar más información acerca del proyecto secreto de las instalaciones de la ATC.

It allows the players to choose one of the comrades that will follow them anywhere. For example, hiring a sniper will help the player spot enemy targets in the distance.\nThe whole game can be played in both singleplayer and co-op modes.",

The events of the third game in the series take place 6 years after the second installment. \r\nAny game of this category is strongly associated with complete freedom of roaming, and the third part pushes all the metrics up: you now have 1 000 square kilometers of space to wander around and upgraded hook which has allowed you continuously to overcome any obstacle. The grappling hook works like a universal tool: you may drag your enemies closer Skorpion-style, climb mountains and cling to foe's cars. \r\nNot only tools but physics provide unique exploring experience — the key word for them is an exaggeration for any event in the game looks like it was cut straight out of an action movie.",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Medal of Honor: Warfighter</b></i> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> video game developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Close_Games\">Danger Close Games</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts\">Electronic Arts</a>. It is a sequel to 2010's series reboot <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(2010_video_game)\">Medal of Honor</a></i> and the fourteenth installment in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(video_game_series)\"><i>Medal of Honor</i> series</a>. The game's single-player campaign picks up where <i>Medal of Honor (2010)</i> left off, as it follows the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs\">Navy SEALs</a> from the previous game's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Force_Operations\">AFO</a> Neptune.</p>\n\n<p>Development of the sequel began after the 2010 reboot was commercially successful. During development, Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) members who worked as consultants for the game were disciplined for releasing classified information. The title was announced on February 23, 2012, and was released in October 2012 on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Upon release, <i>Warfighter</i> received mixed reviews, with praise for the visuals and the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite_(game_engine)\">Frostbite 2</a>, but criticism aimed at the low texture quality on consoles, glitches, confusing storyline and poor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>. The game sold 3 million copies by January 2013, but was a commercial failure for EA, resulting in the <i>Medal of Honor</i> series being taken out of rotation.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p>The gameplay in <i>Warfighter</i> features different aspects than its predecessor. Features from the previous game such as peek and lean, requesting ammunition (now unlimited), and sliding returned. New features in the campaign like the Dynamic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_breaching\">Door Breach</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructible_environment\">environmental destruction</a> have been added.</p>\n\n<h3>Single-player</h3>\n\n<p>The single-player campaign follows the story of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_mission_unit\">Tier 1 operators</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_special_operations_forces\">US Special Operations Forces</a> and features various locations including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\">Bosnia</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan\">Pakistan</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines\">Philippines</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia\">Somalia</a>. The player primarily plays as \"Preacher\" of Task Force Blackbird and \"Stump\" of Task Force Mako. Campaign levels follow a nonlinear path and depict missions which occur at various points in time.</p>\n\n<p><i>Medal of Honor: Warfighter</i>'s multiplayer was not developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Digital_Illusions_CE\">EA Digital Illusions CE</a> who previously helped develop <i>Medal of Honor</i>'s multiplayer. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Close_Games\">Danger Close Games</a> developed the game's multiplayer aspect with DICE's Frostbite 2 engine. Players are involved in a global battle and choose which country they would like to support. There are 12 different tier one units from ten different nations that players can choose from. Reserving the game gave players access to additional content when <i>Warfighter</i> released, including additional weapons and perks. There was also a limited edition of the game that gave players early access to the U.S. SEAL Sniper equipped with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan_Firearms\">McMilllan</a> TAC-300.</p>\n\n<p>The following national task-forces are available in multiplayer: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service_Regiment\">Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service\">British Special Air Service (SAS)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Task_Force_2\">Canadian Joint Task Force 2 (JTF-2)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommando_Spezialkräfte\">German Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsvarets_Spesialkommando\">Norwegian Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK/HJK)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW_GROM\">Polish JW GROM (GROM)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Group\">Russian FSB Alpha (Alfa Group)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea_Navy_Special_Warfare_Flotilla\">Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla (UDT/SEAL)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Särskilda_operationsgruppen\">Swedish Särskilda operationsgruppen (SOG)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force\">U.S. Army Delta Force (SFOD-D)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAL_Team_Six\">U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six (DEVGRU)</a>, and the U.S. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency\">CIA</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Center\">Special Activities Center/Special Operations Group (SAC/SOG)</a> also referred to as \"OGA\" (Other Government Agency). Within these groups, there are six distinct classes that players select from: Spec Ops, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper\">Sniper</a>, Assaulter, Demolitions, Heavy Gunner, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_man\">Point Man</a>. Each class has specific benefits and unique abilities. These nationalities and classes are only available in multiplayer mode.</p>\n\n<p>The game's online servers along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Airborne\">Medal of Honor: Airborne</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(2010_video_game)\">Medal of Honor (2010)</a> were shut down on February 22, 2023.</p>\n\n<p><i>Warfighter's</i> multiplayer features deep customization, for both the player's appearance and their weapons. The player is able to equip each weapon with various barrels, muzzles, magazines, stocks, optics, and paint jobs.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>At a ship dock in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi\">Karachi</a>, Pakistan, Task Force Mako plants a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_charge\">demolition charge</a> to sabotage a terrorist organization's smuggling operation. However, the charge unexpectedly sets off <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_explosion\">secondary explosions</a> which destroy the docks. Debrief by their \"OGA\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency\">Other Government Agency</a>) handler Dusty, a former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army\">U.S. Army</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force\">Delta Force</a> operator, suggests that their charge set off hidden <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETN\">PETN</a> explosives being smuggled in the shipping containers to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines\">Philippines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Mako follows the lead to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela,_Basilan\">Isabela City</a>, Philippines, but are diverted to aid the Philippine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Command_(Philippines)\">SOCOM's</a> Task Force Tiger, led by General Barrera, with rescuing several hostages kidnapped by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Sayyaf\">Abu Sayyaf Group</a>. They identify one of the hostage takers as Marwan al-Khalifa but General Barrera denies Mako's recommendations and instead orders his own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Special_Operations_Command\">NAVSOG</a> operator, \"Tiger 12\", to shoot Khalifa. Tiger 12 wounds Khalifa and, in the chaos, the kidnappers and an unidentified terrorist are able to escape with the hostages. Mother and Preacher link up with the NAVSOG team and push in to secure the hostages. After taking multiple casualties due to General Barrera's poor decisions, Tiger 12 directs the NAVSOG team to ignore Barrera and follow Mother's orders. The NAVSOG and DEVGRU operators are able to secure the hostages, though Tiger 12 is seriously wounded and Khalifa and the unknown terrorist escape. Humiliated, General Barrera uses his political connections to force Mother and Preacher to retire from the Navy.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks later, Task Force Mako, now led by Voodoo and consisting of Stump, Dingo, and Tick, assists a Marine-led <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare\">amphibious raid</a> aimed at curtailing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia\">local Somali piracy</a> and later returns to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bainbridge_(DDG-96)\">USS <i>Bainbridge</i></a> to help aid with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Alabama_hijacking\">hostage situation on a U.S. freighter</a> off the Somali coast.</p>\n\n<p>Preacher takes his discharge and travels to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid\">Madrid</a>, Spain to repair his failing marriage. While waiting for his wife's train to arrive, he unexpectedly sees Khalifa but is unable to stop him from committing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack\">suicide bombing</a> in the station. When Preacher regains consciousness in the hospital, he finds Lena and their daughter are safe as they missed their train. Mother visits and tells him that intel from their missions revealed connections between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Madrid_train_bombings\">the Madrid train bombing</a> (which used smuggled PETN), Abu Sayyaf, the unknown terrorist (now identified as Sa'ad al Din), and a terrorist leader known only as \"the Cleric\". Mother persuades him to join a newly-formed covert unit codenamed Task Force Blackbird, a joint effort between the Navy and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency\">Central Intelligence Agency</a> to investigate the PETN <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterproliferation\">proliferation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Task Force Blackbird, composed of Mother, Preacher, and Ajab, a local Pakistani CIA <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_(intelligence)\">asset</a>, track a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_runner\">gun runner</a> named Faraz who is linked to the PETN smuggling. The operation is kept secret from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan\">Pakistani officials</a> as Blackbird suspects they are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism\">actually aiding the terrorist network</a>. This appears to be confirmed as Blackbird is forced to engage Pakistani <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence\">Inter-Services Intelligence</a> (ISI) agents protecting Faraz. Mother and Preacher apprehend their target and learn the PETN is being supplied by a banker in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai\">Dubai</a> named Hassan. While waiting for extraction, Faraz is killed by an enemy sniper and Ajab barely helps the two escape. While this is happening, Mako has tracked the PETN to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen\">Yemen</a> and raids the terrorist facility storing it. There, they find a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_training_camp\">training camp</a> with mockups of airports and train stations but only half of the PETN stockpile.</p>\n\n<p>Blackbird arrives in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai\">Dubai</a> and capture Hassan for interrogation. The SEALs manage to upload crucial data from Hassan's laptop but are captured before they can escape with Hassan. This data leads Mako to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo\">Sarajevo</a>, where a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnians\">Bosnian</a> weapons dealer named Stovan Bosic is selling the PETN. Mako links up with a team of Polish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW_GROM\">GROM</a>, and the joint forces track Bosic to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo_Olympic_Bobsleigh_and_Luge_Track\">abandoned bobsled/luge track</a> from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics\">1984 Winter Olympics</a> where they capture him. Bosic reveals that two ships containing the PETN had just left Dubai. Dusty notifies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO\">NATO</a> forces in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia\">Croatia</a> to impound one of the vessels while Mako is sent to intercept the other headed for Karachi.</p>\n\n<p>Unbeknownst to them, Sa'ad al Din is interrogating Preacher and Mother aboard that very same cargo freighter. After refusing to divulge information, Mother is executed by Sa'ad al Din. As Mako arrives and assaults the ship, Preacher is able to escape and fight his way to the bridge. He corners and overpowers Sa'ad al-Din before Mako arrives and takes the latter into custody. This enables them to identify the Cleric's identity as Hassan and his compound in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Preacher and Dusty join Mako in the final raid on Hassan's compound. During the assault, Voodoo and Preacher locate Hassan and kill him when he attempts to detonate his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_belt\">suicide vest</a>. Afterward, they return home and pay their respects to Mother at his funeral. Some time after the funeral, Preacher receives a deployment signal on his pager while spending time with his family, but hesitates to answer.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p>One month after <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(2010_video_game)\">Medal of Honor</a></i> was released, John Riccitiello, EA CEO at the time, stated that \"Consumer feedback has been strong to suggest that we've got a franchise now, once again, that we could successfully and effectively sequel in the future.\" On February 18, 2011, Gregory Goodrich, the executive producer of Danger Close Games, said that the company would be pursuing a sequel to the 2010 reboot. On January 11, 2012, retailer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(retailer)\">Game</a> revealed that EA plans to release new entries in the <i>Medal of Honor</i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed\">Need for Speed</a></i> series later that year, which was shown by EA during a confidential presentation. Several video game website outlets such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaku\">Kotaku</a> disclosed an invitation to a March 6, 2012, public unveiling at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference\">Game Developers Conference</a> in San Francisco, indicating that a new installment in the <i>Medal of Honor</i> franchise would have its first public demonstration.</p>\n\n<p><i>Warfighter</i> follows in the footsteps of 2011's <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_3\">Battlefield 3</a></i> by using the Frostbite 2 engine. EA senior creative director Richard Farrelly said Danger Close has been helping push the engine in new directions and has managed to create its own signature look for <i>Warfighter</i>, but \"still have some of the same elements that <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Digital_Illusions_CE\">EA Digital Illusions CE</a></i> have like the micro-destruction and the amazing lighting.\" Farrelly also stated that <i>Warfighter</i> is \"helping make Frostbite 2 a better engine\".</p>\n\n<h3>Beta</h3>\n\n<p>A multiplayer beta for <i>Warfighter</i> was made available on October 5 exclusively for the Xbox 360. The beta featured one map, and one mode. Players had access to all 6 classes. The beta ended on October 15.</p>\n\n<p>Seven members of Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), including one of the alleged <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden\">killers of Osama bin Laden</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bissonnette_(author)\">Matt Bissonnete</a>, who worked as consultants for the game were disciplined for releasing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_United_States\">classified information</a> to the game's creators. They received a punitive letter of reprimand and a partial forfeiture of pay for two months. The two main complaints against the SEALs were that they did not seek the permission of their commanding officer to take part in the project and that they showed the game designers some of their specially designed combat equipment unique to their unit. The military official briefed about the case was not authorized to speak publicly about it.</p>\n\n<h2>Music</h2>\n\n<p>The music for <i>Warfighter</i> was composed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi\">Ramin Djawadi</a>, who also composed the music for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor_(2010_video_game)\"><i>Medal of Honor</i> (2010)</a>. The official soundtrack was released on September 25, 2012, on iTunes and Amazon, nearly one month before the release of the game. The soundtrack consists of 21 tracks, 2 of which were composed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shinoda\">Mike Shinoda</a>, the co-vocalist and rapper of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park\">Linkin Park</a>. Linkin Park's song \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Glass\">Castle of Glass</a>\" from their album <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Things_(Linkin_Park_album)\">Living Things</a></i> serves as the end credits song for <i>Warfighter</i>, and variations of the song appear on the soundtrack. Themes from the previous game reappear as well, albeit in slightly differed forms. The official video was released on October 10, 2012.</p>\n\n<h2>Marketing</h2>\n\n<p>On October 25, 2011, an insert featuring promotional artwork was included with retail copies of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_3\">Battlefield 3</a></i>, featuring little more than a picture and a BBFC logo. On February 23, 2012, <i>Warfighter</i> was officially unveiled, alongside promotional artwork. On March 6, 2012, the premiere trailer was released on YouTube. On September 11, 2012, Danger Close unveiled the first gameplay trailer.</p>\n\n<p>Executive producer Greg Goodrich has stated he wants to avoid the annual war of words that usually kicks off in the buildup to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_3#Marketing_and_release\">EA</a> and Activision's end-of-year first-person shooter releases, and leave it to the publishing executives. He stated \"I think that because of our genre and the history of our franchise... it's just a natural thing to want to go out and pick a fight. [But] if you look at it, almost none of it came from the development team. EA is a very big organisation, and there are a lot of grown-ups and adults that manage things that are out of our control.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Pre-order promotion</h3>\n\n<p>Pre-orders of <i>Warfighter</i> received an automatic upgrade to the Limited Edition of the game at no extra cost. The Limited Edition unlocked the U.S. Navy SEAL Tier 1 Sniper and the McMillan Tac-300 sniper rifle upon the game's launch. All those who had pre-ordered <i>Warfighter</i> received access to the <i>Battlefield 4</i> beta. The <i>Battlefield 4</i> beta took place during Autumn 2013.</p>\n\n<p><i>Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition</i> bundles the limited edition of the shooter with additional in-game content, and is only available for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty\">active</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_components_of_the_United_States_Armed_Forces\">reserve</a> and former U.S. military personnel and US government employees exclusively on GovX.com.</p>\n\n<p>The Military Edition includes all the perks of the game's Limited Edition, as well as \"exclusive in-game unlocks\", One particular unlock is a camouflage pattern named \"Project HONOR\", which is tied to a real-world promotion arranged by EA to raise money for the families of fallen Special Operations soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>Danger Close Games unveiled <i>Medal of Honor: Warfighter: Zero Dark Thirty</i>, the first official map pack. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content\">DLC</a> helped promote both the game and the film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Dark_Thirty\">Zero Dark Thirty</a></i>. EA and Sony pictures released a trailer on September 10, 2012. The pack became available for sale in North America on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on December 17, 2012. Additional maps for the game were made available on December 19, to coincide with the film's initial release. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts\">Electronic Arts</a> donated $1 to nonprofit organizations that support veterans for each <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> map pack sold.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n\n<p><i>Warfighter</i> received mixed reviews. Although the visuals and Frostbite 2 engine were praised, criticism was directed towards its poorly executed and confusing storyline, poor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">AI</a>, linear gameplay, and glitches (even after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_one_patch\">day one patch</a>). Aggregating review website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a> gave the Xbox 360 version 53/100, and the PlayStation 3 and PC versions 55/100.</p>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> said \"This is the first time we've seen a Frostbite Engine game failing to function at a basic level.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer\">Eurogamer</a></i> gave it 5/10, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructoid\">Destructoid</a></i> and <i>VideoGamer.com</i> both also gave the game a 5/10. The <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Post\">Financial Post</a></i> gave the game a 5.5/10 saying that it was \"hard to recommend\", and <i>GameThirst</i> awarded the game 6/10 saying \"There's no need to buy <i>Warfighter</i>, rent it instead.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystiq\">Joystiq</a></i> scored the game 2/5: \"The concept behind <i>Warfighter</i> is sound ... but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(magazine)\">StuffTV</a></i> scored the game a 3/5: \"Warfighter's single-player mode drops the ball so badly that it threatens to overshadow the clever buddy system...\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huffington_Post\">The Huffington Post</a></i> scored the game a 2/5. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaku\">Kotaku</a></i> reviewed the game poorly: \"It's so brazenly unremarkable, its storytelling so amateurish, its action so rote, that it feels like a master class in middling modern warfare\" and \"<i>Medal of Honor Warfighter</i> is slipshod, uninspired, unpolished, and unfun.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer\">Game Informer</a></i> gave the game a 5/10 saying \"this once-loved series may be dangerously close to being put in a casket.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a></i> gave the game a 6/10 noting that the linear gameplay failed to add up to the tension, there is too much ammo and enemies show up in predictable places making the game too easy, poor storytelling, confined maps, and bugs like showing up in invisible places.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the aforementioned military consultant input, bugs related to the depiction of military hardware were still present when the game shipped. Several days after release, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Systems_Daily?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Soldier Systems Daily</a>, a tactical and defense industry blog which does not usually cover video games, posted an in-game screenshot showing a rifle with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_iron_sights\">backup iron sights (BUIS)</a> mounted backwards.</p>\n\n<p>Electronic Arts responded to the largely negative criticism saying that the launch \"is coming in below our expectations\". EA Labels president Frank Gibeau said, \"We're disappointed with the critical reception. Internal testing and mock reviews indicated that the game is better than the [Metacritic] score we have right now. We believe it is. However, we are seeing folks out there that just don't like the game.\" Gibeau went on to say that EA is \"not happy\" with how the game has been received by the critics.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the mixed response, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_&amp;_Sciences\">Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences</a> nominated <i>Medal of Honor: Warfighter</i> for \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_Audio_Design\">Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design</a>\" during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Annual_D.I.C.E._Awards\">16th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The game drew criticism from Pakistan for its portrayal of the country as a \"hotbed of terrorism\". Medal of Honor: Warfighter and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II\">Call of Duty Black Ops II</a>, both of which were released in 2012, were banned by the All Pakistan CD, DVD, Audio Cassette Traders and Manufacturers Association (APCDACTM) over their depictions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Pakistan\">terrorism in the country</a> and, in MoH Warfighter, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence\">ISI's</a> apparent support for terrorist organizations. However, access to the game did not see to be hindered as at least one large store in the capital of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad\">Islamabad</a> was still making brisk sales of both games and pirated versions of the game are also easily available.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the bad reviews, on October 27, <i>Medal of Honor: Warfighter</i> climbed to the number one spot in UK sales.According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesIndustry_International\">GamesIndustry International</a>, the game sold over 300,000 copies in its first week on shelves, \"significantly below analyst expectations\". <i>Warfighter</i> was the eighth-best-selling game in the month of October. The game dropped from the top 10 selling games charts in November 2012 following the release of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II\">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_4\">Halo 4</a></i>. In January 2013, it was reported that the game had shipped 3 million copies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Moore_(business)\">Peter Moore</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer\">COO</a> of EA, revealed in their Q3 2013 earnings call that due to the game's \"poor critical and commercial reception\", the <i>Medal of Honor</i> series would be placed on hold. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hilleman\">Richard Hilleman</a>, chief creative officer at EA described <i>Warfighter</i>'s poor performance as \"an execution problem\" caused by a lack of quality leadership. Hilleman stated that while <i>Medal of Honor</i> could make a return, EA's focus would be on the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(video_game_series)\">Battlefield</a></i> series.</p>\n\n<h2>Sequel</h2>\n\n<p>The next <i>Medal of Honor</i> game would not be released for eight years until <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respawn_Entertainment\">Respawn Entertainment</a> released <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Above_and_Beyond\">Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond</a></i> on December 11, 2020. It is set in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II\">World War II</a> like the earlier games in the series. Unlike the other installments, <i>Above and Beyond</i> was released as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality\">VR</a> on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a> only.</p>\n\n",

    "description": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure and a straight continuation of the first part of the franchise. It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies.\n\n###Story\nThe game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures.\n\n###DLC\nThe Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: \"Dark Dracula\" and \"Armored Dracula\" bring only new characters skins and sprites.",

    "description": "BFG Edition is an updated re-release of the 2004's Doom 3, a part of Doom series.\nChanges from Doom 3\nBFG Edition features improved graphics and sound, two expansion packs, and certain updates that alter the gameplay. It introduced checkpoints that automatically save the player’s progress. There are slight changes in the controls, as this version doesn’t allow the use of hotkeys. This edition also includes a copy of the original Doom in its Ultimate version.\nPlot\nThe plot is identical to Doom 3. The game is set on Mars in the 22nd century. The player controls a nameless space marine (nicknamed \"Doomguy\" by the fans). His task is to defeat the demons of Hell that invaded the Delta Labs research facility. Doom 3 features the series' trademark violence, monsters, and black humor.\nExpansion packs\nBFG Edition includes two expansion packs. The Resurrection of Evil was previously released in 2005. The plot, set two years after Doom 3, follows a team that comes to a space station and discovers the hellish Artifact. This expansion introduces new weapons, such as The Grabber and the double-barreled shotgun, as well as additional multiplayer maps.\nThe Lost Mission is a new story expansion that was not previously released. It allows you to play as a marine from the Bravo squad that was only mentioned in the original Doom 3. The protagonist's goal is to descend into Hell to find and destroy a teleportation device that demons are going to use to invade Earth.",

    "description": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience. It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.<br></li><li>\tRealistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.<br></li><li>\tRefined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”<br></li><li>\tImproved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.<br></li><li>\tNew Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. <br></li><li>\tVarious Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.<br></li><li>\tBullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!<br></li><li>\tBullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!<br></li><li>\tExpanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields.<br></li><li>\tNew Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.</li></ul>",

    "description": "What is Pandemic Train?In Pandemic Train you are in charge of the crew aboard a train roaming the postapocalyptic wasteland, ravaged by both war and a deadly plague. Your goal is to survive long enough to discover the cure… or die trying. Humanity’s fate is in your hands! Start your journey now! You are in charge!Pandemic Train is a survival game with roguelike and strategy elements in which you command the crew and passengers aboard an old train powered by a steam engine. The plot takes place in an alternative timeline of the 20th century when a catastrophic virus epidemic decimates the world's population. A mysterious plague kills infected people within 24 hours, leading to widespread panic, riots, and war. The world is in ruins and you are the only hope for its survival. Explore the wastelands, collect resources, fight bandits, and find a cure for a deadly disease!Survive!In Pandemic Train the world has become a very inhospitable place. People will die along the way, and you have to minimize the damage. The resources are scarce, so you have to distribute them very carefully. And worst of all - there are lots of hungry wolves around. And by ‘hungry wolves’ we mean desperate people who will do anything to defeat you and stop your search for the cure. To defeat your opponents, take care of the resources you acquire and produce. They are limited, so use them carefully. Unfortunately, this is not the end of bad news...Manage the resourcesIn the harsh reality of Pandemic Train, you need to be self-sufficient - you grow your own food, breed the livestock, gather and purify your own drinking water, and take care of a proper ammunition supply. You have to utilize every bit of scrap or junk at your disposal and turn it into something useful. This often leads to difficult decisions, for example - there’s rarely enough medicine for everyone, so you’ll have to decide who is worth the treatment, and who will suffer or even be left to die.Fight the plague!The main goal of your actions is to create a vaccine and save the remnants of humanity from extinction. The longer you manage to keep the train moving, the less likely that the crew will have contact with the virus, and your scientists will get more time to work on the medication. You can customize the train to your needs - decide how many people are on it and how many train cars are going to be attached to the engine. But remember - the bigger the party, the harder it is to keep it in check. You are the only hope for mankind. You are the last hope… for humanity.",

He has a simple task - to find androids, deviated from the path given by humans. He has a special vision, it allows him to see events as they happened.

She, along with the girl, escapes from the house as a result of a conflict with her father, the owner of Kara.\nMarkus is a caretaker android.

Apart from the usual races, players can participate in so-called skill challenges. After every mission, the player's score is saved and displayed to all his friends.

In order to solve the energy crisis, humanity learned to harvest the energy from Hell, and when something went wrong and a demon invasion has started, it’s up to the player to control the Doomslayer and destroy the evil.\nDoom is a fast-paced game that restores the concept of instant health packs and leaves the player against armies of Hell with no cover, no health regeneration, or help from anyone. After damaging monsters enough, they will start glowing, which will allow players to perform glory kills to restore some health. While exploring the levels, players will come across secrets, collectible items, or upgrade points for the weapons and armor. The single-player campaign silent protagonist has a noticeable personality. He gets visibly annoyed and angry in his actions during expository cutscenes and forces his way through the game. Multiplayer maps gather players in Deathmatch/”king-of-the-hill” type game modes, with all the weapons from the single-player campaign.",

    "description": "Far Cry 4 is a first-person shooter, which inherits traditions of the original Far Cry franchise. However, the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East, where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland, but suddenly things go the wrong way, and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses, players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning, the whole map is not available, so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.",

    "description": "Prey (2017) is a single-player sci-fi first-person shooter developed by Arkane Studios Austin and published by Bethesda Softworks. While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games.\nThe game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you'll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.\nPrey's gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.",

Behind the terrorists, there is a mafia organisation that wants to hide the truth about the impossibility to control the biological weapons developed by it, which turns people into zombies. Bioterrorists opposed by a detachment of special forces - it serves two other characters.\nThe action of the game periodically turns from a personal vendetta into a global catastrophe and back. One President-zombie is replaced by whole cities of infected.

Four story campaigns, after going through one line of the plot, you can choose another lens and see the events from a different perspective.\nThere are many enemies, but ammunition",

Meeting the rest of the family at his mom's funeral, he decides to rebuild the gang and gain control of the state.\nThe game makes a brilliant connection with missions and open world actions that you are able to do around the cities. You can steal cars, buy guns, hunt for collectables and do some side quests, while different characters give you specific missions in order to push the plot forward. Streets are filled with people as well as plenty of vehicles to steal. Fictional brands of cars, tanks, bikes are available to be stolen from any place around the city. Armoury contains pistols, rifles, hand-machine guns or a rocket launcher as well as melee weapons giving player freedom in anything he's doing in GTA.",

For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing.\nThe farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time.\nThe hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close. The game does not set any ultimate or primary goal, its many possibilities are designed for an unlimited time.",

    "description": "Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. \nWe play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is \"Dead Eye\" — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. \nThe game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",

A strange phenomenon for which scientists can find no explanation has occurred in the skies around the world. The Supernatural Science Research Organization (SRO) has sent agents out to various regions to investigate this phenomenon. It is soon discovered that these strange occurrences are connected to an archaic mystery – an as-of-yet unknown history of two worlds, about to come to light...About Bright Memory: Episode 1\nDuring the initial stages, since it was pretty difficult to estimate the number of copies that would sell, I decided to create the kind of game that could start out as a demo and later use crowdfunding support to develop further. I’ve finally managed to amass enough time and funding, so the action and general gameplay will remain as-is but the story and stages are all being reworked.\nFrom here on out, I will no longer be developing Bright Memory: Episode 1 any further, but I plan on making regular “experimental” additions of various new features, etc., which players will be able to try out. Once development of Bright Memory: Infinite is complete, it will be distributed as a separate game, but those who have already purchased Bright Memory: Episode 1 will receive a special “100% off” discount coupon for Bright Memory: Infinite prior to its release.",

After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. \nWhile being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism.",

    "description": "Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. \nPlot\nLike the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.\nGameplay\nBattlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.\nModes\nBattlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",

    "description": "Thief is a stealth-action game, the 4th installment in the Thief series and the first game since 2004 Thief: Deadly Shadows. The game was made as an attempt to reboot the franchise. \nJust as previous entries, the game takes place in the dark fantasy world with notable steampunk and Victorian era influence. You play as Garrett, the master thief who awakens after one-year slumber caused by accident in one of his missions. He finds out that his hometown is plagued by a mysterious disease “The Gloom.” \nThe gameplay can be described as first-person stealth-action with the heavy emphasis on the variability of completing missions. Sneaking behind the enemies is usually a more effective way of performing tasks than openly fighting with them. Garrett possesses several different tools and weapons like lockpicks, prybar, etc. One of Garrett’s few weapons is bow which has 8 types of arrows and the full range of application from killing and poisoning enemies to putting out torches and distracting guards.",

Both games are based on the world of Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel Metro 2033 - in post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of subway lines groups of very different people survive. And not only people. There are mutated people there, and mutated animals. They are distinguished by unusual abilities, but even more - behaviour strategies. In the struggle for the remnants of resources, all these beings spend their gloomy days.\nAll characters use unusual and unexpected means for life and war. Something is created from the remnants of a past, normal life, something has already appeared in a new, changed world.\nLocations are struck by an unusual synthesis of the ruins of a known world and traces of a catastrophe.\nFrom the previous game Metro: Last Light differs, according to general opinion, by careful work on the remarks and shortcomings of the previous game. The set of weapons is significantly expanded, the technologies of Metro 2033 have become more developed.\nThe game has two fundamentally different endings and five additions.",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a first-person shooter, a direct sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops that features its protagonists. The story is divided into two time periods. It starts in 1986 with Alex Mason that has to return to work after his retirement to catch Raul Menendez, responsible for multiple crimes. The second storyline takes place in 2025; you play as David, Mason’s son, who also needs to find Menendez who sparks the second Cold War. The game has several endings depending on your actions in both storylines.\nThe campaign mode in Black Ops II is also selected in two parts. There are story missions, where you can make decisions that will affect the future of the characters. Additionally, Strike Force missions, available in 2025, feature permanent death - if the character is killed, you can’t return to the checkpoint, and have to continue the game without them.\nLike two previous games in the series, Black Ops II has the Zombies mode with a completely new story. It starts with nuclear experiments in 2025 Nevada that cause the appearance of zombies.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 5 (also known as Biohazard 5 in Japan) is the third-person shooter with elements of a survivor-horror game. This is the fifth main installment in Capcom’s acclaimed franchise Resident Evil.  \r\nThe story follows Chris Redfield, the protagonist of the original Resident Evil, and his partner Sheva Alomar. As the members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, they are tasked to intercept an illegal bioweapon trade in Kijuju, Africa. Upon arrival, they find out that Kijuju is infected by Las Plagas, parasites that turn its carriers into zombie-like creatures.   \r\nThe game is notable for being a departure from the series survival horror roots towards more action-oriented gameplay style. The other significant innovation in the series brought with Resident Evil 5 is cooperative multiplayer for two players. There are many situations during the game that requires two players cooperation therefore if in singleplayer the second characters is controlled by AI.",

    "description": "In an ultimately frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city ruler has to manage both the inhabitants and the infrastracture the citizens live in. Leader’s tactical skills face challenges, frequently questioning morality and the basic foundation of what we consider an organized society. Here optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\nWhat decisions will you make so the society can survive? What will you do when pushed to the limits? And...\n...who will you become in the process?\n\nTHE CITY MUST SURVIVE\nFrostpunk is a city-survival game where heat means life and every decision comes with a cost.\n\nMAINTAIN THE HOPE\nSurvival is about hope and will to live. Your ability to spark and maintain these two in your people will be a determinant factor for success.\n\nMAKE THE LAW\nSociety is a group of people abiding the same rules and sharing similar beliefs. Establishing laws and customs will be a crucial factor shaping your society.\n\nWEIGHT YOUR CHOICES\nWill you allow child-labour? How will you treat the sick and wounded? Frostpunk challenges a player’s tactical skills, while questioning one’s morality.\n\nEXPLORE\nThe world covers not only bits of the past but also the potential means to secure the future of your people.\n\n\"(...) this is a game about finding reasons to survive rather than just the means to go on living.\"\n- Adam Smith, Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\"In a steampunk ice age, the only thing that can be crueler than the bitter cold are the decisions you have to make to keep your people alive.\"\n- Stephanie Chan, VentureBeat\n\"(...) decisions push your morality to its limits for the sake of productivity, which could make for an captivating, draining adventure when the game releases later this year.\"\n- Suriel Vazquez, Game Informer",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed Origins is an open-world action game developed by Ubisoft. It further continues the series after Assassin's Creed Syndicate.\nThe story is set in two time periods simultaneously. In 2017, the order of Templars has recovered an ancient artifact that will allow them to seize control over humanity. Assassins plan to get the artifact back in their hands. Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.\nLevels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The \"eagle vision\" mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.\nThe game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.",

Hunt for answers inhumanity’s last remaining shelter.\n\nAscend humanity’s last remaining shelter, a great tower-city. The tower is torn by violence, poverty, and chaos. Conquer your enemies, discover the secrets of the superstructure and your own origin and obtain the power to challenge The Keymaster. \n\nThe game takes place in the future, after a global cataclysm where the remains of humanity live in a tower built by The Architect, who died mysteriously years ago. Everyone knows the truth, no one says it aloud.\n\nThe world ruled by The Keymaster is harsh. A person’s worth depends on the category of implants they have, defining their whole lives. The implants—given to them in childhood—determine which social group a person belongs to. If you weren’t lucky enough to get a good life, there is nothing you can do.\n\nIt's no surprise that a rebellion starts.\n\nYou are a cyber-warrior, the only one capable of fighting both in the physical world and in cyberspace.

In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. \nThe story\nIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.\nIn addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.",

    "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a science fiction game loosely based on the role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020.\r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nThe game is set in the year 2077 in a fictional futuristic metropolis Night City in California. In the world of the game, there are developed cybernetic augmentations that enhance people's strength, agility, and memory. The city is governed by corporations. Many jobs are taken over by the robots, leaving a lot of people poor and homeless. Night City has a roaring underworld, with black markets, underground surgeons, drug dealers, and street gangs abound.\r\n\r\n###Characters\r\nThe main protagonist is fully customizable, including his or her sex and appearance, and goes by the nickname V. He or she is an underground mercenary who does “dirty business” for the various contractors. An NPC companion named Jackie joins the protagonist early at the game, and various other companions may join the player on certain missions as the plot demands. However, the game has no parties and no companion system.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls V from the first person view, with the third-person view used for cutscenes only. The protagonist can travel across the city on feet or using various vehicles, in a manner some observers compared to GTA series. There are many options for the character customization, including three character classes, and a variety of augmentations V can install to enhance his or her abilities.",

Emperor Nero says from the balcony of the Palace that the defenders of the city should protect him. Marius, the General of Rome (you will play for him) and the commander of the defenders, gives a small sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it, saying this is the key to victory. Then he secures the ruler in the secret room and begins his story.\n\nThe player will have to fight a lot with the enemies. There is a weak attack, there are quick sword strikes, allowing to deprive the enemy off balance, as well as a potent offence, for which you need to hold the button for a few seconds. It is better to attack at the right moments: striking, dodging and parrying, you can bring the combo counter to indecently high numbers. \n\nThere is also a system of finishing the enemy, which can finally overthrow the opponent. Over the heads of heavily wounded enemies there is an icon in the form of a skull, and by pressing the right trigger, you can finish them with the help of the provided reception.",

The Nintendo Switch 2 version includes support for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con_2\">Joy-Con 2</a> mouse controls for more precise aiming.</p>\n\n<p>Nintendo announced <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> for Switch at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2017\">E3 2017</a>.

Nintendo revealed <i>Beyond</i> in June 2024 and confirmed the Switch 2 version in April 2025.</p>\n\n<p><i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> was released on December 4, 2025, eighteen years after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption\"><i>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</i></a> (2007).

Critics praised its environmental art, gameplay additions and enhanced graphical fidelity on Switch 2, but criticized the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">non-player characters</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world\">open-world</a> elements.</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p><i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game\">action-adventure game</a> played from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games)\">first-person</a> perspective. Players control <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samus_Aran\">Samus Aran</a> using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con\">Joy-Con</a> controllers to move, jump, aim at enemies and objects, and fire weapons.</p>\n\n<p><i>Beyond</i> is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay\">open-ended</a> game that takes place across a vast world of different regions, in which gameplay focuses on solving various puzzles, exploring rooms, and defeating enemies with a variety of weapons and the aid of a \"lock-on\" function that allows Samus to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_strafing\">move in a circle</a> while staying aimed on an enemy. The lock-on function can also help with interacting with objects, such as connecting a Grapple Beam to swing between platforms. The game uses a first-person view, except in Morph Ball mode, in which Samus' suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_shooter\">third-person camera</a>. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_gaming)\">heads-up display</a>, which simulates the inside of Samus' helmet during first-person view, provides a radar and mini-map functions, as well as displays on health and ammo amounts; when fighting bosses, the display also keeps track of their health. The player can scan objects and lifeforms to gather information.</p>\n\n<p>New to <i>Beyond</i> are psychic powers, which allow Samus to operate specialized mechanisms, see hidden platforms, and perform guided shots against enemies. <i>Beyond</i> also adds a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_world\">hub world</a>, Sol Valley, that Samus crosses with a motorcycle, the Vi-O-La. The motorcycle can perform manoeuvres that provide a speed boost and allow Samus to defend against enemies. At times, Samus is assisted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Federation_(Metroid)\">Galactic Federation</a> members—these individuals help with solving puzzles where needed, and assist in combat, though players will be required to keep them alive and revive them with psychic healing powers when they fall. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_2\">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version allows players to use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con_2\">Joy-Con 2</a> controller as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse\">mouse</a>, similarly to a PC <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>The Space Pirates, using Metroids capable of possessing a host, attack a Federation facility on Tanamaar which recently unearthed an artifact. Samus (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Yvette\">Erin Yvette</a>) is dispatched by the Galatic Federation to prevent the Pirates from stealing it. The Pirates are being led by Sylux (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laith_Wallschleger\">Laith Wallschleger</a>), a rogue hunter whom Samus had previously encountered. In the confrontation with him, Sylux accidentally damages the artifact, causing it to activate and teleport everything in its surroundings to the unknown planet of Viewros.</p>\n\n<p>On Viewros, Samus exploring the Chronos Tower. She acquires a crystal with psychic capabilities and uncovers a holographic recording from Chatoyant Vooloon, the last priest of the extinct Lamorn race. Facing extinction, the Lamorn made plans for their legacy to be preserved and teleported to a new world by a Master Teleporter at the pinnacle of the Chronos Tower. It can only be activated by five keys scattered across Viewros. Samus arrives in the jungles of Fury Green, where she rescues the Federation technician Myles MacKenzie (David Goldstein). They are attacked by feral creatures called grievers.</p>\n\n<p>Myles sets up a base camp in Fury Green to help Samus. After finding the first key, Samus learns that the Lamorns were psychically cultivating a tree to grow a memory fruit, a seed that will preserve their legacy on a new world. The cultivation can only be completed by feeding the fruit with green energy—a life energy uncovered by the Lamorns contained in crystals across Viewros. Samus acquires a motorcycle called Vi-O-La and battles Sylux. Sylux takes control of the Chronos Tower, erects a barrier around it, and infuses Metroids into the master teleporter key's guardians.</p>\n\n<p>Samus encounters the Federation soldiers Reger Tokabi (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalani_Queypo\">Kalani Queypo</a>), Ezra Duke (Jason E. Kelley), Nora Armstrong (Jennifer Sun Bell), and the combat robot VUE-995 (Richard Dorton). Recordings reveal how the Lamorn race hoped to use green energy to nurture the planet, it made the wildlife aggressive and transformed the Lamorn into grievers. The surviving Lamorns sealed themselves into the Chrono Tower, with hope someone would end their suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Samus secures the keys for the teleporter, and uses a teleporter chip recovered by Reger to find mech parts. Myles repairs a giant Federation mech to breach a forcefield that blocks entry back into the Chrono Tower. Samus and the squad enter the tower and activate the master teleporter. Sylux ambushes them, but Samus defeats him in an alternate dimension. Sylux recovers and critically damages the teleporter. The soldiers restrain him long enough for Samus to leave Viewros via the teleporter. Samus plants the memory fruit and accelerates its growth using the psychic crystal, which sprouts into rapidly growing psychic tree. In tribute to the soldiers, she leaves on the tree a pendant she received from Reger.</p>\n\n<p>On 100% completion, a cutscene details Sylux's backstory as a Federation field captain, in which his reckless attempt to claim a Space Pirate superweapon left him as the sole survivor of his platoon, which he chose to blame on Samus and the Federation.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p><i>Metroid Prime 4</i> was produced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensuke_Tanabe\">Kensuke Tanabe</a>, who produced the previous <i>Metroid Prime</i> games. Nintendo announced <i>Prime 4</i> during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Direct\">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2017\">E3 2017</a>, and confirmed it was not developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Studios\">Retro Studios</a>, which had developed the previous <i>Prime</i> games. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer\">Eurogamer</a></i> reported that <i>Prime 4</i> was being developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai_Namco_Studios\">Bandai Namco Studios</a> in Japan and Singapore. The Bandai Singapore staff included former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucasArts\">LucasArts</a> staff who had worked on the canceled <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_1313\">Star Wars 1313</a></i>. In 2018, the Nintendo of America president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Fils-Aimé\">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>, said <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> was \"well into development\" and \"proceeding well\". Nintendo did not show it at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2018\">E3 2018</a>; the Nintendo of America marketing manager <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Trinen\">Bill Trinen</a> said they would share more when they \"had something that would wow people\".</p>\n\n<p>In January 2019, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_EPD\">Nintendo EPD</a> manager Shinya Takahashi announced that development had restarted under Retro Studios with Tanabe remaining as producer. Takahashi said the previous studio had not met Nintendo's standards and that the decision to restart was not taken lightly. In October 2020, Retro posted a job advertisement seeking storyboard artists to work on \"emotional\" and \"interesting and innovative scenes that elevate the narrative\". The <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Games_Chronicle\">Video Games Chronicle</a></i> writer Andy Robinson took this as an indication of a more cinematic focus. The Nintendo developer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Level_Games\">Next Level Games</a>, the third-party studio <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos\">Virtuos</a>, and other teams provided support. Tanabe also contributed material to the scan logs.</p>\n\n<p>Nintendo perceived demand for an open-world <i>Metroid</i> game influenced by their 2017 game <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></i>, but found this was incompatible with <i>Metroid</i> gameplay. As a compromise, they implemented the hub world and added the Vi-O-La motorcycle to assist the pacing. As development took longer than planned, Nintendo opted to ignore new developments in action and shooting games and prioritize the adventure game elements.</p>\n\n<h2>Release and promotion</h2>\n\n<p>Nintendo released the first trailer on June 18, 2024, which revealed the full title. The trailer showcased similar gameplay to previous <i>Metroid Prime</i> games, with Samus exiting her gunship, navigating a research facility using her morph ball and scanning abilities, encountering the bounty hunter Sylux who first appeared in <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Prime_Hunters\">Metroid Prime Hunters</a></i>, and ending with an establishing shot of a forest world. Nintendo also announced that <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> was scheduled for release in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Nintendo released a second trailer in a Direct presentation on March 27, 2025, introducing the forest planet Viewros setting, new enemies, the Lamorn race, and Samus's psychic powers. In a Direct presentation on April 2, Nintendo announced a version for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_2\">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with enhanced visual resolution, the option to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution\">4K</a> at 60 frames per second or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p\">1080p</a> at 120 frames per second, and optional mouse controls when using the Joy-Con 2 controllers. A 20-minute demo, covering the opening level first seen in the June 2024 trailer, was made playable at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_2#Announcement_and_promotion\">Nintendo Switch 2 Experience</a> events held worldwide between April and June, and showcased during a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Treehouse\">Nintendo Treehouse</a> livestream. This same demo would later appear at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamescom\">Gamescom</a> in August, at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Expo_Canada\">Fan Expo Canada</a> in Toronto, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario\">Ontario</a>, and would be distributed for Switch 2 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_kiosk\">kiosks</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation\">Target</a> stores in the US in November.</p>\n\n<p>On September 12, Nintendo released a new trailer showcasing a desert environment and Samus's motorcycle, along with the release date, December 4, 2025. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiibo\">Amiibo</a> figures were also announced for Samus, Samus with the Vi-O-La motorcycle, and Sylux. A trailer focusing on the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition was released on November 4, and a seven-minute long \"overview trailer\" was released on November 14. On the day of the game's release, seven music tracks were released on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Music\">Nintendo Music</a> app.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<h3>Pre-release</h3>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards_2024\">the Game Awards 2024</a>, <i>Beyond</i> was nominated for Most Anticipated Game. In November 2025, media outlets were allowed to play a 90-minute demo, including the opening sequence and a section in the Fury Green area of Viewros. The presentation, puzzles and combat were praised. Ethan Van Allen of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer\">Game Informer</a></i> felt Samus's new psychic powers were \"a standout\" and praised the new mouse controls. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Life\">Nintendo Life</a></i>'s Alex Olney felt they blended well with the gameplay and were \"refreshingly different\".</p>\n\n<p>In <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Games_Chronicle\">Video Games Chronicle</a>,</i> Andy Robinson found the preview \"solid, if not particularly surprising\" and wrote that it featured an entertaining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_battle\">boss battle</a>. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> writer Logan Plant wrote that while <i>Beyond</i> \"likely won't redefine <i>Metroid</i> in any meaningful way – or live up to the unrealistic hype built by nearly a decade of waiting\", it features \"classic <i>Metroid Prime</i> exploration and combat, an intriguing setup, gorgeous art direction, and great technical performance\". Ari Notis of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)\">Polygon</a></i> wrote that while <i>Beyond</i> was not a rehash of the original <i>Metroid Prime</i> games, with some tonal differences, it \"plays the series' greatest hits\".</p>\n\n<p>Journalists criticized the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">non-player character</a> Myles MacKenzie, feeling he detracted from the series' sense of isolation. Plant described the period spent with Myles as ranging from \"mildly annoying to downright infuriating\". Robinson said Myles made him worried that <i>Beyond</i> would not be the <i>Metroid</i> game he hoped for. Olney characterized Myles's dialogue as \"sub-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe\">Marvel</a> humor\" and hoped he suffered \"a painful, embarrassing death offscreen\". Donaldson hoped the sequence was not indicative of the full game, and Notis said it was \"hard to fully convey just how out of place Myles feels\". Van Allen thought Myles provided enjoyable comic relief, but hoped that companions were used sparingly.</p>\n\n<p><i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator\">review aggregator</a> website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a> and received a \"strong\" approval from critics according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic\">OpenCritic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Life\">Nintendo Life</a></i>, Ollie Reynolds wrote <i>Beyond</i> was \"absolutely nothing like [he] imagined — and that's a good thing\". He felt that, while the more linear level design and traditional environments did not modernize the series' formula as much as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Dread\">Metroid Dread</a></i> (2021), <i>Beyond</i> deserved to be regarded as among the best <i>Metroid</i> games. Reynolds also felt that the storytelling and art design were among the best in the series, and while the Galactic Federation soldiers were a controversial addition, \"none of them are even remotely as irritating as previews suggested\" and contributed greatly to the overall story. He said that the Sol Valley hub world initially felt empty but became surprisingly interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Logan Plant of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> said <i>Beyond</i> felt more like classic 3D <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(series)\">Legend of Zelda</a></i> games, but did not see this as a bad thing, as <i>Zelda</i> and <i>Metroid</i> \"shared a lot of the same DNA\". He also felt that the atmosphere shifted between isolated exploration and sci-fi action setpieces, and said this helped to keep the game fresh. Plant said that each environment felt fresh, and noted Volt Forge, a futuristic factory accompanied by heavy guitar music, as a standout. He noted that <i>Beyond</i> was the most linear <i>Metroid</i> game, and that he \"never felt <i>truly</i> lost\", but felt this would help new players. Contrary to Reynolds, Plant felt that Sol Valley was devoid of interesting locales and activities, and served only to pad out the runtime. He emphasized how it was the only place to acquire green crystals, which are necessary to progress.</p>\n\n<p>Rhys Wood of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechRadar\">TechRadar</a></i> wrote that <i>Beyond</i> had a unique atmosphere, in line with <i>Metroid Prime</i>. He echoed Plant's sentiment that Sol Valley felt barren and lifeless, and felt the bosses and enemies lacked in variety. However, he praised the aesthetic of other areas. He felt some areas were too linear, but that this did not detract from the overall quality. Similarly to Reynolds, Wood found the Galactic Federation troopers less overbearing than he had feared, and that they appeared infrequently, allowing for long sequences of isolated exploration. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)\">Edge</a></i> gave <i>Beyond</i> 4 out of 10, critizing the backtracking and final <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_quest\">fetch quest</a> and writing: \"Nintendo games have tested our patience before, but rarely in so many ways at once, and not without a core brilliance that makes such transgressions forgivable.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Amiibo functionality was criticized for locking certain features. The Samus Amiibo unlocks a radio feature for listening to the soundtrack in the desert, while the Vi-O-La Amiibo unlocks skins based on how far the player travels.</p>\n\n<p>In its first week, <i>Beyond</i> was the third-bestselling game in the UK, behind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports_FC_26\"><i>EA Sports FC 26</i></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_World\"><i>Mario Kart World</i></a>. The Switch 2 version accounted for 83% of sales. In Japan, the Switch 2 version sold 21,415 physical copies in the first four days. In North America, the Switch 2 version reached number one on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_eShop\">Nintendo eShop</a> chart.</p>\n\n",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Half-Life</b></i><!--Do not add stylization in this since it's only used in box art and title screen.--> is a 1998 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> game developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation\">Valve Corporation</a> and published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Studios\">Sierra Studios</a> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows\">Windows</a>. It was Valve's debut product and the first game in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)\"><i>Half-Life</i> series</a>. The player assumes the role of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a>, a scientist who must escape from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility\">Black Mesa Research Facility</a> after it is overrun by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrials_in_fiction\">alien</a> creatures following a disastrous scientific experiment. The gameplay consists of combat, exploration and puzzles.</p>\n\n<p>Valve was disappointed with the lack of innovation in the FPS genre, and aimed to create an immersive world rather than a \"shooting gallery\". Unlike other games at the time, the player has almost uninterrupted control of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character\">player character</a>; the story is mostly experienced through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_sequence\">scripted sequences</a> rather than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene\">cutscenes</a>. Valve developed the game using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldSrc\">GoldSrc</a>, a heavily modified version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine\"><i>Quake</i> engine</a>, licensed from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software\">id Software</a>. The science fiction novelist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Laidlaw\">Marc Laidlaw</a> was hired to craft the plot and assist with design.</p>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> received acclaim for its graphics, gameplay and narrative and won more than 50 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game\">PC</a> \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_the_Year_awards\">Game of the Year</a>\" awards. It is considered one of the most influential first-person shooter games and one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_video_games\">greatest video games</a>. By 2008, it had sold more than nine million copies. It was ported to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a> in 2001, along with the multiplayer expansion <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Decay\">Decay</a></i>, and to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X\">OS X</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel\">Linux</a> in 2013. Valve ported <i>Half-Life</i> to its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine\">game engine</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)\">Source</a>, as <i><b>Half-Life: Source</b></i> in 2004. In 2020, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)\">Black Mesa</a></i> was released, an unofficial fan-made remake of <i>Half-Life</i> developed by Crowbar Collective using the Source engine.</p>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> inspired numerous fan-made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)\">mods</a>, some of which became standalone games, such as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_(video_game)\">Counter-Strike</a></i> (2000), <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Defeat\">Day of Defeat</a></i> (2003), and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Co-op\">Sven Co-op</a></i> (1999). It was followed by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack\">expansion packs</a> <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force\">Opposing Force</a></i> (1999) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift\">Blue Shift</a></i> (2001), developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox_Software\">Gearbox Software</a>, and the sequels <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\">Half-Life 2</a></i> (2004), <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One\">Episode One</a></i> (2006), <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_Two\">Episode Two</a></i> (2007) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx\">Half-Life: Alyx</a></i> (2020).</p>\n\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter\">first-person shooter</a> that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most first-person shooters at the time, which relied on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene\">cut-scene intermissions</a> to detail their plotlines, <i>Half-Life</i>'s story is told mostly using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_sequence\">scripted sequences</a> (bar one short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)\">first-person viewpoint</a>. In line with this, the player rarely loses the ability to control the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character\">player character</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a>, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees \"through his eyes\" for the entire length of the game. <i>Half-Life</i> has no <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)\">levels</a>; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles briefly appear on screen as the player progresses through the game. With the exception of short loading pauses, progression throughout the game is continuous, with each map directly connecting to the next, although levels with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation\">teleportation</a> are an exception.</p>\n\n<p>The game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning a valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_gaming)\">bosses</a> in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the boss. Late in the game, the player receives a \"long jump module\" for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEV_suit\">HEV suit</a>, which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_puzzles\">jumping puzzles</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)#Setting\">Xen</a> toward the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>The player battles alone for the majority of the game, but is occasionally assisted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">non-player characters</a>; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player. The guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and pass on relevant plot information. An array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, vortigaunts, and headcrab zombies. The player also faces hostile human soldiers and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_operation\">Black Ops</a> assassins. <i>Half-Life</i> includes online multiplayer support for both individual and team-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch_(video_games)\">deathmatch</a> modes. It was one of the first mainstream games to use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASD_keys\">WASD keys</a> as the default control scheme.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n\n<p>At the underground <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility\">Black Mesa Research Facility</a>, the theoretical physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman\">Gordon Freeman</a> participates in an experiment on a crystal of unknown origin. This triggers a \"resonance cascade\", which greatly damages the facility and teleports in hostile alien creatures through a portal between the Xen and Earth dimensions. Venturing to the surface, Freeman discovers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._federal_government\">U.S. federal government</a> soldiers have been dispatched to cover up the incident by killing humans and aliens alike. A scientist instructs him to make his way to the Lambda Complex to stop the alien invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Freeman kills a giant creature inside a rocket engine test facility and uses an underground monorail to reach a rocket silo. He launches a satellite to help the Lambda team close the portal, but is captured by soldiers and left for dead in a trash compactor. Escaping through a waste treatment complex, Freeman travels through a part of Black Mesa filled with alien specimens, collected long before the resonance cascade.</p>\n\n<p>Overpowered by the aliens, the soldiers withdraw. Freeman fights across the rest of the facility to reach the Lambda Complex, where he discovers secret teleportation technology. There, scientists inform him that the satellite launched earlier didn't work to stop the cascade due to a powerful alien creature preventing them from closing the portal. They teleport him to the alien dimension <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)#Setting\">Xen</a> to kill it.</p>\n\n<p>Freeman encounters dead scientists who teleported there before him. He kills a large alien, the Gonarch, and finds a factory that manufactures alien soldiers. Finally, he enters the Nihilanth's lair and kills it. Freeman is detained by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_the_Half-Life_series#G-Man\">G-Man</a>, a mysterious interdimensional agent who claims his \"employers\" wish to hire Freeman. If he accepts, Freeman is placed into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasis_(fiction)\">stasis</a>; if not, he is teleported to his death.</p>\n\n<h2>Development</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation\">Valve</a>, based in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkland,_Washington\">Kirkland, Washington</a>, U.S., was founded in 1996 by the former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\">Microsoft</a> employees <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell\">Gabe Newell</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Harrington\">Mike Harrington</a>. For their first product, Valve settled on a concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) game. They did not want to build their own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine\">game engine</a>, as this would have created too much work for a small team and Newell planned to innovate in different areas. Instead, Valve licensed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine\"><i>Quake</i> engine</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II_engine\"><i>Quake II</i> engine</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software\">id Software</a> and combined them with their own code. Newell estimated that around 75% of the final engine code was by Valve. As the project expanded, Valve cancelled development of a fantasy role-playing game, <i>Prospero</i>, and the <i>Prospero</i> team joined the <i>Half-Life</i> project.</p>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> was inspired by the FPS games <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)\">Doom</a></i> (1993) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)\">Quake</a></i> (1996),<sup>: 9, 11 </sup> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King\">Stephen King</a>'s 1980 novella <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mist_(novella)\">The Mist</a></i>, and a 1963 episode of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outer_Limits_(1963_TV_series)\">The Outer Limits</a></i> titled \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borderland\">The Borderland</a>\". According to the designer Harry Teasley, <i>Doom</i> was a major influence and the team wanted <i>Half-Life</i> to \"scare you like <i>Doom</i> did\". The project had the working title <i>Quiver</i>, after the Arrowhead military base from <i>The Mist</i>. The name <i>Half-Life</i> was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_letter\">Greek letter</a> λ (lower-case <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda\">lambda</a>), which represents the <i>decay constant</i> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life\">half-life</a> equation.<sup>: 31 </sup> According to the designer Brett Johnson, the level design was inspired by environments in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga\">manga</a> series <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(manga)\">Akira</a></i>.</p>\n\n<p>Valve struggled to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_On-Line\">Sierra On-Line</a> signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the <i>Quake</i> engine. Sierra gave Valve an advance of around $1 million in exchange for 30% of the revenue and 100% of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property\">intellectual property</a>; the rest of development was funded by Newell and Harrington. Valve first showed <i>Half-Life</i> in early 1997; it was a success at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3\">E3</a> that year, where Valve demonstrated the animation and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games\">artificial intelligence</a>. Novel features of the artificial intelligence included fear and pack behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Valve aimed for a November 1997 release to compete with <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II\">Quake II</a></i>. By September 1997, the team found that, while they had built some innovative aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. Playtesting produced \"lukewarm\" responses. Sierra would not agree to extra funding, so Newell took out a loan to fund additional development to rework the game.</p>\n\n<p>Valve took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game and then spent a month iterating on the level. When the rest of the team played the level, which the designer Ken Birdwell described as \"<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard\">Die Hard</a></i> meets <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Dead\">Evil Dead</a></i>\", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, it had several interesting things happen in it, all triggered by the player rather than a timer so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level responded to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.</p>\n\n<p>To move forward with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer but found no one suitable. Instead, Valve created the \"cabal\", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story. The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated since the required commitment created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout\">burnout</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The cabal produced a 200-page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document\">design document</a> detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the narrative, and hired the science fiction novelist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Laidlaw\">Marc Laidlaw</a> to help manage the script. Laidlaw said his contribution was to add \"old storytelling tricks\" to the team's ambitious designs: \"I was in awe of [the team]. It felt to me like I was just borrowing from old standards while they were the ones doing something truly new.\" Rather than dictate narrative elements \"from some kind of ivory tower of authorial inspiration\", he worked with the team to improvise ideas, and was inspired by their experiments. For example, he conceived the opening train ride after an engineer implemented train code for another concept.</p>\n\n<p>Valve initially planned to use traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene\">cutscenes</a>, but switched to a continuous first-person perspective for lack of time. Laidlaw said they discovered unexpected advantages in this approach, as it created a sense of immersion and enforced a sense of loneliness in a frightening environment. Laidlaw felt that non-player characters were unnecessary to guide players if the design had sufficiently strong \"visual grammar\", and that this allowed the characters to \"feel like characters instead of signposts\". An early version of <i>Half-Life</i> began immediately after the disaster, with the environments already wrecked. Laidlaw worked with Johnson to create versions of the lab environment before the disaster to help set the story. He said: \"These were all economical ways of doing storytelling with the architecture—which was my whole obsession. The narrative had to be baked into the corridors.\"</p>\n\n<p>Within a month of the cabal's formation, the other team members started detailed game development, and within another month began <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playtesting\">playtesting</a> through Sierra. The cabal was intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting. They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzles and made them into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_item\">action items</a> to be fixed on the next iteration. Later, with most of the main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions. They then collected and interpreted statistically to fine-tune levels further. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for <i>Half-Life</i>'s success, and was reused for <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2\">Team Fortress 2</a></i> from the start.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the detail of <i>Half-Life</i>'s development has been lost. According to Valve employee Erik Johnson, two or three months before release, their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_SourceSafe\">Visual SourceSafe</a> source control system \"exploded\". Logs of technical changes from before the final month of development were lost, and code had to be recovered from individual computers. The revised version of <i>Half-Life</i> shown at E3 1998 received the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Critics_Awards\">Game Critics Awards</a> for \"Best PC Game\" and \"Best Action Game\".</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n\n<p>To promote <i>Half-Life</i>, Valve's chief marketing officer, Monica Harrington, promoted Valve's reputation in the industry, with conference talks about their advances in game development, leading to coverage in the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal\">Wall Street Journal</a></i>. <i>Half-Life</i> was released on November 19, 1998. When Sierra told Valve it was not planning to promote it beyond launch, Harrington threatened that Valve would \"walk away from our agreement and tell the industry that had fallen in love with Valve how screwed up Sierra really was\". In response, Sierra reissued <i>Half-Life</i> in a \"Game of the Year\" edition, boosting sales. In 2001, after renegotiating with Sierra, Valve gained the <i>Half-Life</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property\">intellectual property</a> and online distribution rights for its games.</p>\n\n<p>Valve released two <i>Half-Life</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo\">demos</a>. The first, <i>Half-Life: Day One</i>, contained the first fifth of the game and was distributed with certain graphic cards. The second, <i>Half-Life: Uplink</i>, was released on February 12, 1999, and featured original content. A short film based on <i>Half-Life,</i> also titled <i>Half-Life: Uplink</i>, was developed by Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and released on February 11. The protagonist is a journalist who infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.</p>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> was censored in Germany to comply with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Department_for_Media_Harmful_to_Young_Persons\">Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons</a>, which regulates depictions of violence against humans. Valve replaced the human characters with robots, spilling oil and gears instead of blood and body parts when killed, among other changes. In 2017, <i>Half-Life</i> was removed from the German censorship list. To acknowledge this, Valve released <i>Half-Life Uncensored</i>, a free <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content\">downloadable content</a> pack, that reverts the censorship.</p>\n\n<h3>Other versions</h3>\n\n<p>Valve canceled a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting\">port</a> of <i>Half-Life</i> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS\">MacOS</a>, developed by Logicware, in 2000. Newell said the port was substandard and would have made Mac players \"second-class customers\". <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Heineman\">Rebecca Heineman</a>, the co-founder of Logicware, denied this, saying that Valve cancelled the port as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.\">Apple</a> had angered them by misrepresenting sales projections. She said the port was complete and three weeks from release. Valve released ports for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X\">OS X</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a> in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Captivation Digital Laboratories and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox_Software\">Gearbox Software</a> developed a port of <i>Half-Life</i> for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a>, with new character models and textures and an exclusive expansion, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift\">Blue Shift</a></i>. Following the cancellations of several third-party games in the wake of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega\">Sega</a>'s decision to discontinue the Dreamcast in March 2001, Sierra cancelled the port weeks before its scheduled release in June, citing \"changing marketing conditions\". <i>Blue Shift</i> was ported to Windows. The Dreamcast port became the basis of the <i>Half-Life</i> port for PlayStation 2, released in late 2001. This version added competitive play and a co-op expansion, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Decay\">Half-Life: Decay</a>.<sup><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)#cite_note-40\">[38]</a></sup></i></p>\n\n<p>In 2004, Valve released <i>Half-Life: Source</i>, a version of <i>Half-Life</i> ported to their new game engine, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)\">Source</a>. It adds <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll_physics\">ragdoll physics</a>, advanced water effects, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound\">5.1 surround sound</a>. At launch, it received mediocre reviews for its lack of significant gameplay and visual enhancements, although <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> still recommended it. Retrospective reception has been more negative, owing to the game's instability and frequent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitches\">glitches</a>. The deathmatch mode was ported to Source separately in 2006 as <i>Half-Life Deathmatch: Source</i>. Following the release of the <i>Half-Life</i> 25th anniversary update in 2023, both ports were delisted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)\">Steam</a> and do not appear in its search results. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)\">Black Mesa</a></i>, a third-party remake of <i>Half-Life</i> developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowbar_Collective\">Crowbar Collective</a> on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)\">Source</a> engine, was published as a free mod in September 2012 and later approved by Valve for a commercial standalone release.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2023, for the 25th anniversary of <i>Half-Life</i>, Valve updated the Steam version to revert content to its original 1998 state, fix long-standing bugs, and add content including the <i>Half-Life: Uplink</i> demo, four new multiplayer maps, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck\">Steam Deck</a> support, rendering improvements, and support for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution\">4K resolution</a> monitors. Valve also released an hour-long documentary on the creation of <i>Half-Life</i>, featuring commentary from the original developers, designers and artists. Two days after the release, <i>Half-Life</i> reached 33,471 concurrent players on Steam, its highest-ever number.</p>\n\n<h2>Mods</h2>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> received support from independent game developers, supported and encouraged by Valve. With the game, Valve included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor\">Worldcraft</a>, the level design tool used during development, and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit\">software development kit</a>, enabling developers to create <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)\">mods</a>. Both tools were updated with the release of the patch 1.1.0.0. Supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and level editors such as the multiple engine editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuArK\">QuArK</a>) were either created or updated to work with <i>Half-Life</i>.<sup>[<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></i>]</sup></p>\n\n<p>The <i>Half-Life</i> software development kit served as the development base for many mods, including the Valve-developed <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_Classic\">Team Fortress Classic</a></i> and <i>Deathmatch Classic</i> (a remake of <i>Quake</i>'s multiplayer deathmatch mode in the GoldSrc engine). Other mods such as <i>Counter-Strike</i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Defeat\">Day of Defeat</a></i> (<i>DOD</i>) began life as the work of independent developers who later received aid from Valve. Other multiplayer mods include <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_(video_game)\">Firearms</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Selection_(video_game)\">Natural Selection</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Co-op\">Sven Co-op</a></i>. Single-player mods include <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Darkstar\">USS Darkstar</a></i> (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoological\">zoological</a> research spaceship) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Hunger\">They Hunger</a></i> (2000–2001, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror\">survival horror</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_conversion\">total conversion</a> trilogy involving zombies). To promote the 2003 film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(2003_film)\">Underworld</a></i>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures\">Sony Pictures</a> commissioned video game developer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_Games\">Black Widow Games</a> to develop a promotional tie-in mod titled <i>Underworld: Bloodline</i>. The mod was available on Sony Pictures' official website until the end of 2007 and remains the only officially licensed Half-Life mod tied to a Hollywood film.</p>\n\n<p>Some <i>Half-Life</i> modifications received retail releases. <i>Counter-Strike</i> was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the <i>Platinum Pack</i> (2000), as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)\">Xbox</a> version (2003), and as a single-player spin-off, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Condition_Zero\">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a></i> (2004), as well as in two versions using the Source engine. <i>Team Fortress Classic</i>, <i>Day of Defeat</i>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunman_Chronicles\">Gunman Chronicles</a></i> (2000, a futuristic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)\">Western movie</a>-style <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_conversion\">total conversion</a> with emphasis on its single-player mode) and <i>Sven Co-op</i> were also released as standalone products. <i>Half-Life</i> is also the subject of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\">YouTube</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre\">improv</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying\">roleplaying</a> series <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_VR_but_the_AI_is_Self-Aware\">Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman's_Mind\">Freeman's Mind</a></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Valve's network was infiltrated by hackers. Among the stolen files was the unreleased <i>Half-Life</i> mod <i>Half-Life: Threewave</i>, a canceled remake of the <i>Quake</i> mod <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malice_(video_game_mod)\">Threewave CTF</a></i>. The files were found by fans on a Vietnamese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP_server\">FTP server</a> in February 2016 and unofficially distributed that September.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n\n<h3>Critical reception</h3>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> received critical acclaim by reviewers. On the review aggregation website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic\">Metacritic</a>, <i>Half-Life</i> has a score of 96 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Gaming_World\">Computer Gaming World</a></i>'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Green_(writer)\">Jeff Green</a> said it was \"not just one of the best games of the year. It's one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and—in its single-player form—is the best shooter since the original <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)\">Doom</a>.</i>\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_(magazine)\">Next Generation</a></i> wrote: \"It is fast paced, it is dramatic, and it brings the very idea of adventure on a PC out of the dark ages and into a 3D world. All that and not a single Orc in sight.\" <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\">IGN</a></i> described it as \"a tour de force in game design, the definitive single player game in a first-person shooter\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a></i> said it was the \"closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken\".</p>\n\n<p>Several reviewers cited the level of immersion and interactivity as revolutionary. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllGame\">AllGame</a></i> said, \"It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that.\" <i>Hot Games</i> commented on the realism, and how the environment \"all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison\". <i>Gamers Depot</i> wrote that it was the most immersive game they had played.</p>\n\n<p>The final portion of the game, taking place in the alien world of Xen, was generally considered the weakest. Besides introducing a wholly new and alien setting, it also featured a number of low-gravity jumping puzzles. The GoldSrc engine did not provide as much precise control for the player during jumping, making these jumps difficult and often with Freeman falling into a void and the player restarting the game. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)\">Wired</a></i>'s Julie Muncy called the Xen sequence \"an abbreviated, unpleasant stop on an alien world with bad platforming and a boss fight against what appeared, by all accounts, to be a giant floating infant\". <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Playground\">The Electric Playground</a></i> said that <i>Half-Life</i> was an \"immersive and engaging entertainment experience\" in its first half and that it \"peaked too soon\".</p>\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_&amp;_Sciences\">AIAS</a>' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Annual_Interactive_Achievement_Awards\">2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, <i>Half-Life</i> was awarded \"Computer Entertainment Title of the Year\" and \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Action_Game_of_the_Year\">PC Action Game of the Year</a>\"; it also received nominations for \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Game_of_the_Year\">Game of the Year</a>\" and outstanding achievement in \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_Art_Direction\">Art/Graphics</a>\", \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_Story\">Character or Story Development</a>\", \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_Game_Design\">Interactive Design</a>\", and \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.I.C.E._Award_for_Outstanding_Technical_Achievement\">Software Engineering</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version for <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_(magazine)\">Next Generation</a></i>, rating it three out of five, and wrote that \"it may be getting old, but there's still a surprising amount of life in <i>Half-Life</i>\". The PlayStation 2 version was a nominee for <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Playground\">The Electric Playground</a></i>'s 2001 Blister Awards for \"Best Console Shooter Game\", but lost to <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)\">Xbox</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, 2001, and 2005, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Gamer\">PC Gamer</a></i> named <i>Half-Life</i> the best PC game of all time. In 2004, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy\">GameSpy</a></i> readers voted <i>Half-Life</i> the best game of all time. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamasutra\">Gamasutra</a></i> gave it their Quantum Leap Award in the FPS category in 2006. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot\">GameSpot</a> inducted <i>Half-Life</i> into their Greatest Games of All Time list in May 2007. In 2007, <i>IGN</i> described <i>Half-Life</i> as one of the most influential video games, and in 2013 wrote that the history of the FPS genre \"breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-<i>Half-Life</i> and post-<i>Half-Life</i> eras\". In 2021, the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian\">Guardian</a></i> ranked <i>Half-Life</i> the third-greatest game of the 1990s, writing that it \"helped write the rulebook for how games tell their stories without resorting to aping the conventions of film\".</p>\n\n<p>According to Newell, <i>Half-Life</i> was budgeted with the expectation of lifetime sales of around 180,000 copies. However, it was a surprise hit. In the United States, <i>Half-Life</i> debuted at #8 on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Data\">PC Data</a>'s weekly PC game sales chart for the November 15–21 period, with an average retail price (ARP) of $49. It rose to sixth place the following week, before dropping to position 10 for the week ending December 5. During the December 6–12 period, the game climbed back to sixth place; by this time, its ARP had dropped to $36. It placed between sixth and eighth on PC Data's weekly charts through the end of December, and its ARP rose back to $45 by the week ending January 2. PC Data declared <i>Half-Life</i> November's sixth-best-selling PC game in the United States, a position it held for the month of December. While its U.S. sales were below 100,000 copies by November 30, it sold 212,173 copies and earned revenues of $8.6 million in the United States by the end of 1998.</p>\n\n<p>In January 1999, <i>Half-Life</i> debuted at #3 on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart-Track\">Chart-Track</a>'s PC game sales rankings for the United Kingdom, and remained in PC Data's weekly top 10 for the entire month, peaking at #4. By January 19, after two full months of availability, global sales of <i>Half-Life</i> surpassed 500,000 units. In the United States, it was the fifth-best-selling PC game for the month of January. On PC Data's weekly charts, it rose to #2 from February 7–20, with an ARP of $35. Holding a position in the weekly top 10 for the rest of February, it climbed to fourth for the month. The game remained in PC Data's weekly top 10 until the week of March 21 and dropped to position 11 for March as a whole. In the United Kingdom, it placed second in February—behind the debut of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_(video_game)\">Baldur's Gate</a></i>—and fifth in March. In April, it claimed #3 on Chart-Track's rankings and dropped to #16 on those of PC Data. On April 23, Sierra announced that global sales of <i>Half-Life</i> had reached almost 1 million copies.</p>\n\n<p>After maintaining the 16th place for May in the U.S., <i>Half-Life</i> exited PC Data's monthly top 20 in June. <i>Half-Life</i> became the fifth-best-selling PC game of the first half of 1999 in the U.S. Its domestic sales during 1999 reached 290,000 copies by the end of September. During 1999, it was the fifth-best-selling PC game in the U.S., with sales of 445,123 copies. These sales brought in revenues of $16.6 million, the sixth-highest gross that year for a PC game in the U.S. The following year, it was the 16th-best-selling PC game in the U.S., selling another 286,593 copies and earning $8.98 million.</p>\n\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version received a \"Silver\" sales award from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_and_Leisure_Software_Publishers_Association\">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. <i>Half-Life</i>'s global sales reached 2.5 million units by July 2001. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)\">Edge</a></i> noted in 2003 that \"a significant number of the 7.5m copies of the PC version were bought because the game offered such potential for community-driven expansion\". As of November 16, 2004, eight million copies of the game had been sold, and by 2008, 9.3 million copies had been sold at retail. <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records\">Guinness World Records</a></i> awarded <i>Half-Life</i> the world record for Best-Selling First-Person Shooter of All Time (PC) in the <i>Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Expansions and sequels</h2>\n\n<p><i>Half-Life</i> was followed by an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack\">expansion pack</a>, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force\">Opposing Force</a></i>, on November 1, 1999, developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox_Software\">Gearbox Software</a>. Players control Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Corporal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Shephard\">Adrian Shephard</a>, who fights a new group of aliens called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_X\">Race X</a> and Black Ops units after being split from his team. Gearbox developed a second expansion pack, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift\">Blue Shift</a></i>, in which players control <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Calhoun\">Barney Calhoun</a>, a security guard at Black Mesa, as he attempts to escape the facility. It was developed as a bonus campaign for the Dreamcast port of <i>Half-Life,</i> but was released for Windows on June 12, 2001, after the port was canceled. Gearbox created a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_video_game\">cooperative</a> multiplayer expansion pack, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Decay\">Decay</a>,</i> exclusively for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PlayStation 2</a> port of <i>Half-Life</i> which is played through the perspectives of Gina Cross and Colette Green, two Black Mesa scientists.</p>\n\n<p><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2\">Half-Life 2</a></i> was announced at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2003\">E3 2003</a> and released in 2004. The player controls Freeman 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the dystopian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_17\">City 17</a>, where he joins a rebellion against an alien regime. It was followed by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_video_game\">episodic</a> sequels <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One\">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a></i> (2006) and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_Two\">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a></i> (2007). After <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreleased_Half-Life_games\">cancelling several other <i>Half-Life</i> projects</a>, Valve released <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx\">Half-Life: Alyx</a></i> in 2020.</p>\n\n",

Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover's soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. \n\nWhen not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward.

    "description": "The sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company is the ninth game in the Battlefield series overall. The plot is set in an alternate history timeline, in which there's an ongoing war between the United States and Russia; and the Russians are winning. They have already conquered most of Eurasia and made Latin American Countries their allies. The protagonist is a member of Bravo-2 spec ops squad. He is tasked with eliminating colonel Arkady Kirilenko, the leader of a secret project that is about to produce a Russian superweapon that can be used to defeat the US once and for all. The rest of Bravo-2 is computer-controlled. The NPC will assist the player and are technically immortal; however, they cannot complete missions without player's actions.\nWhile most of the time you play as infantry, there are certain stages where players can drive tanks, helicopters, gun turrets and other vehicles. One of the most distinctive features of the game's Frostbite engine is that all elements of the environment are fully destructible. Besides plot-driven single-player campaign, there's also multiplayer that allows five different modes. All characters are divided into four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Medics, in particular, can speed up the health regeneration; however, lost hit points are slowly restored by themselves.",

It is inspired by the Mad Max movie series.\nPlot and setting\nThe game is set in 2165, thirty years after the events of the original Rage. More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.\nGameplay\nLike in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style. By killing multiple enemies in a short amount of time, the player can enter Overdrive mode, which increases the guns' power and the amount of loot. There is also a multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "Dead Space 2 is a third-person action shooter including both survival and horror elements. The game is a direct sequel to the first chapter of the Dead Space franchise. The game is set in the space environment of the future. The story of the second part begins in 2511, 3 years after the events held in the first game. The main character Isaac Clarke is awakened after 3-year coma (after the escape from Aegis VII) in an insane asylum in the Sprawl on Titan. A soon as the event pace raises and antagonists start pursuing him to get his brains (for building a new Marker), Isaac realizes his only goal – the destruction of the Marker. Players are offered to join the protagonist’s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear – special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.",
